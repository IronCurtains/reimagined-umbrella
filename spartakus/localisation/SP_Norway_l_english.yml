### Ideas ###

NOR_liberal_conservative_agreement_idea:0 "The Liberal-Conservative Agreement"

NOR_recovering_economy_idea_desc:0 "While the Norwegian economy suffered after the Great war, this was not so critical as the effects from the London Stock Exchange Crash.

### Events ###

nor.0.t:0 "The Kingdom of Norway in 1932"
nor.0.d:0 "Norway was for many years ruled by foreign powers, Sweden and Denmark. Norway tried to gain independence in 1814, but it should take until 1905 for the nation to finally gain their independence. Under the great war, Norway was not participating in it, but they were affected by it and the revolutions that took place on the European continent. \n\nThe 1920s in Norway was an era of postwar economic recovery of the country. At the same time did many Norwegians travel over to the United States of America to find new opportunities. The people of Norway was also introduced to new inventions, like cars, electricity and radio. But at the start, these were mostly reserved for the richest individuals and counties in the country. The era after the war had also seen the rich get richer, while the poor got poorer. \n\nOver most of the 1920s, the left-wing in Norway had just gained around 30% of the votes, but this would begin to change. With the London Stock Exchange Crash in 1929, Norway was hit as they had been good trade partners with Britain since the end of the great war. Both the socialist left and the nationalist right blamed this on the Liberal and the Conservative parties as they had govern Norway through this period. The political effects of this was shown in the 1930 election, where the Liberal and Conservative parties gained just enough votes to not be felled by the socialists. An agreement between these two parties, that had since before Norway’s independence was in opposition to each other, was made. The Conservative Party should govern with Liberal support. \n\nBut most of the population does not want a continuation of Liberal or Conservative rule. While steps has been made to combat the economic downturn, unemployment are still high and the poor has gotten poorer. New election will come up in 1933. Many believes that the socialists has a chance to form government. There are also those on the extreme right that are plotting to stop this. Maybe this is the preamble to a Second Norwegian Civil War or a Norwegian Revolution."
