### Events ###
rom.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Romania"
rom.1.d:0 "Romania at the dawn of the 1930s is a country paralysed by fear. The primary objective of Romanian foreign policy since independence, the unification of Greater Romania, has been achieved in the aftermath of the Great War. However now the country's effective encirclement by Communist powers puts all of that in jeopardy. Soviet intervention in the Hungarian-Romanian war prevented the deposition of the Leninist Kun regime, halting the Romanian advance at the banks of the Tisa river. An uneasy peace followed, leaving Romania in possession of Transcarpathia, and much of the Great Hungarian Plain, which remain under military governance to this day. Further instability in Serbia left Romania burdened with West Banat, another province in limbo. \n\nSurrounded on all sides but the south by hostile Communist regimes and virtually abandoned by it's western allies, the path ahead is unclear. Liberals call for dialogue and hopefully a lasting peace, while those to the right believe through renewed military might even the Russian bear can be staved off. Growing in popularity in this uncertain environment among the outraged middle-classes and intelligensia are far-right populist movements, seeking to blame Romania's ills on infiltration and 'colonisation' from ethnic and religious minorities, and calling for a return to God, and a great spiritual revolution to save Romania. Meanwhile, the very far-left ideologies threatening to tear Romania apart from the outside now also rise from within, with Lenin's doctrines growing in popularity among ethnic minorities and the lower classes, who are suffering from the worst of the Great Depression."
rom.1.a:0 "România Mare will be preserved at all costs."

rom.2.t:0 "1932 Elections postponed"
rom.2.d:0 "With Romania still battered by industrial unrest, civil turmoil and a perilously insecure government, it has been declared the planned elections of 1932 have been called off for reasons of public safety - the next election is scheduled for April 1933."
rom.2.a:0 "We have no choice."

rom.14.t:0 "The Great Depression"
rom.14.d:0 "Beginning across the Atlantic with the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Great Depression has since spread across the globe, bringing poverty, recession and disaster wherever it goes. First hit by the crisis in a series of waves beginning in early 1930, the liberal government failed to implement effective solutions to the crisis, floundering with abortive austerity measures and the failure to implement Covertability Controls until mid-1931. \n\nWhile the crash seems to have stabilised here, it has left Romania penniless & hungry, like a beggar on the streets of Europe. Various ideological and economic ideas compete on how to best rebuild the country, soon to be fought out in the looming elections."
rom.14.a:0 "Dark times."

rom.39.t:0 "Purchasing a Capital Ship"
rom.39.d:0 "As the capstone to our efforts to modernise the Romanian Navy, we need a state-of-the-art flagship at the helm of our fleet; while Romania lacks the industrial capacity or facilities to build one ourselves, there are a number of friendly western benefactors who would be happy to sell us one of their models."
rom.39.a:0 "Purchase a French Battleship."
rom.39.b:0 "Purchase an Italian Heavy Cruiser."
rom.39.c:0 "Purchase a British Battlecruiser."

## Eastern Entente ##

rom.46.t:0 "Invited to the Eastern Entente"
rom.46.d:0 "In a commuique from Bucharest, the nation of Romania, one endangered by Bolshevism as direly as we, invited our country to join in their revived Entente, for mutual defence and military cooperation against the red threat."
rom.46.a:0 "Together we will be a bulwark against Bolshevism!"
rom.46.b:0 "We can't risk it."

rom.47.t:0 "Country turns down our offer"
rom.47.d:0 "Our efforts it seems have fallen flat - a shortly-worded reply has come from the other side, and they have seen fit to politely decline our offer."
rom.47.a:0 "Shoot."

rom.61.t:0 "West Banat Negotiations"
rom.61.d:0 ""
rom.61.a:0 "A superb idea!"
rom.61.b:0 "We can't risk it."

rom.62.t:0 "Serbia rejects our proposal"
rom.62.d:0 ""
rom.62.a:0 "They'll regret this."

rom.63.t:0 "Serbia agrees!"
rom.63.d:0 ""
rom.63.a:0 "Excellent!"

rom.64.t:0 "Romania approaches us with an Alliance"
rom.64.d:0 ""
rom.64.a:0 "Romania stands as the first line of defence against Bolshevism!"
rom.64.b:0 "This is not in our interest."

rom.65.t:0 "Alliance Refused"
rom.65.d:0 ""
rom.65.a:0 "Shoot."

## Oradea Conference ##

rom.3.t:0 "Romania calls Oradea Conference"
rom.3.d:0 "Seemingly desiring to resolve the matter of occupied Slovak and Hungarian land, as well as potentially greater land disputes between the Sovetsglas countries and Romania, Bucharest has called a conference in the Transylvanian city of Oradea, promising candor and plain dealing."
rom.3.a:0 "We shall see what comes of it."

rom.4.t:0 "Romania calls Oradea Conference"
rom.4.d:0 "Seemingly desiring to resolve the matter of occupied Slovak and Hungarian land, as well as potentially greater land disputes between the Sovetsglas countries and Romania, Bucharest has called a conference in the Transylvanian city of Oradea, promising candor and plain dealing."
rom.4.a:0 "We shall see what comes of it."

rom.5.t:0 "Hungarian Interests at the Oradea Conference"
rom.5.d:0 "The Hungarian delegation at Oradea have principally presented the ongoing occupation of the Great Hungarian Plain, demanding the withdrawal of Romanian troops and the restoration of Hungarian national sovereignty there. However, in perhaps more coded language delegates have also made reference to greater ambitions to prewar territorial claims, stretching as far as Szeklerland."
rom.5.a:0 "We will return the Great Hungarian Plain."
rom.5.b:0 "We will return all of Northern Transylvania."
rom.5.c:0 "Not one inch of Romanian soil!"

rom.6.t:0 "Slovak Interests at the Oradea Conference"
rom.6.d:0 "The diplomats from the small alpine country of Slovakia have presented arguably the most reasonable interests at the conference - the return of that contentious and confusing region Transcarpathia, called Podkarpatská in their language."
rom.6.a:0 "We will return Transcarpathia."
rom.6.b:0 "The mountains are ours!"

rom.7.t:0 "Polish Interests at the Oradea Conference"
rom.7.d:0 "Polish presence here is an afterthought to the main issues on the table regarding Hungary & Slovakia, but they were invited nonetheless for politeness' sake, and as expected have presented their interests in regard to Bukovina, the small northeastern Romanian province lying on the Polish border."
rom.7.a:0 "We will return Bukovina."
rom.7.b:0 "Bukovina is Romanian!"

rom.8.t:0 "End of the Oradea Conference"
rom.8.d:0 "With treaties signed and toasts made, diplomats have returned home to Bratislava, Budapest, Warsaw and Bucharest. The initial impression is of an excellent diplomatic endeavour towards peace in the region, but how this plays out in the long term does remain to be seen."
rom.8.a:0 "Hurrah!"

rom.9.t:0 "End of the Oradea Conference"
rom.9.d:0 "Called off two days early, dissatisfaction from Sovetsglas diplomats has brought the conference called at Oradea to an early halt. Intended to soothe and abate tensions, this may have only inflamed them."
rom.9.a:0 "Dialogue with such people is impossible..."

rom.10.t:0 "Oradea Conference Concludes"
rom.10.d:0 "The Oradea Conference has ended, with diplomats have returned home to Bratislava, Budapest, Warsaw and Bucharest. Having secured the return of Hungary and Slovakia's rightful territories, the conclusion is already being hailed as a victory for peace across Eastern Europe."
rom.10.a:0 "Excellent! A victory for our Balkan friends."

rom.11.t:0 "Oradea Conference Concludes"
rom.11.d:0 "Called off two days early, stubbornness from the representatives of the hosting Romania has brought the conference called at Oradea to an early halt. Their lack of willingness to compromise on territorial matters has incensed many in the Sovetsglas, who are beginning to wonder whether this was simply some vain opportunity for Romania to flaunt her ill-gotten gains."
rom.11.a:0 "Dialogue with capitalists will never go well..."

rom.13.t:0 "Oradea Conference Concludes"
rom.13.d:0 "The Oradea Conference has ended, with diplomats have returned home to Bratislava, Budapest, Warsaw and Bucharest. With an outcome far better than any on our side could have hoped for, Romania has caved to even the most punitive of our territorial demands, despite unrest at home. In such a cowed state, it hardly seems they are a threat at all any more."
rom.13.a:0 "Romania is no longer a threat, it would seem."

rom.12.t:0 "Soviets sign Non-Aggression Pact"
rom.12.d:0 "Pleased with our willingess for compromise at the recently-concluded Oradea Conference, the Soviet Union has approached us for the signing of a non-aggression pact, suring up peace for Romania for the foreseeable future."
rom.12.a:0 "We are safe!"

## 1933 Election Events ##

rom.15.t:0 "1933 Election Campaigns Begin"
rom.15.d:0 "With things having stabilised since last year, it seems safe enough to open the campaigning season of the 1933 elections."
rom.15.a:0 "May the best Romanian win. That will be us, naturally."

rom.16.t:0 "Politician supports dialogue with Sovetsglas"
rom.16.d:0 "A senior Minister-without-Portfolio within the Maniu government, reportedly a close friend of the Prime Minister himself, has sparked a wave of confusion, protest and nationwide debate after statements yesterday seemed to put forward a new policy of dialogue and reconciliation with the Hungarian & Slovak governments regarding the occupied territories. The remarks have caused a wave of protest from Conservative opposition members, division within the Liberals, and sheer outrage from the nationalist intelligensia centered in Bucharest."
rom.16.a:0 "The Government comes out in support of the policy."
rom.16.b:0 "The Government reprimands the Minister."
rom.16.c:0 "The Minister is assassinated by Ultranationalists."
rom.16.e:0 "Dialogue with our Hungarian, Slovak and Russian friends is essential."
rom.16.f:0 "Territory matters for nothing if you mistreat the people within it..."

rom.17.t:0 "Communal Violence in Târgu Mures"
rom.17.d:0 "Following the assassination of the Conservative ethnic Romanian mayor of Târgu Mures - a city split nearly half/half between Romanians and ethnic minorities, chiefly Hungarians - the city has broken out in a wave of retaliatory violence, riots and protests. The rule of law seems to be disintegrating, with reprisals against ethnic minorities being ignored or in some cases partaken in by the local police. Furthermore, local ultranationalist and far-right groups have taken it upon themselves to pin the blame also on 'traitorous' Romanian leftists, accused of supporting and aiding the foreign Communists supported by neighbouring countries."
rom.17.a:0 "Enforce the Law, this will not stand."
rom.17.b:0 "This is why you need a militarily-minded government!"
rom.17.c:0 "There is a string of counter-assassinations on local minority leaders."
rom.17.e:0 "Local leftists and ethnic minorities band together to defend themselves."
rom.17.f:0 "Any dialogue cannot ignore historic repression faced by ethnic minorities."

rom.18.t:0 "Debate over Rural Backwardness"
rom.18.d:0 "Even after the Land Reform of 1921, Romania remains a deeply agrarian and backwards country, with over 80% of Romanians being employed in agricultural work. This situation is compounded by the state education system which is ineffective across the board and has failed to mediate any meaningful upward class mobility. Work in the fields is harsh, long, and still often presided over by cruel and punitive landowners, continuing as it has for several hundred years - while the fruits of industrialisation have enriched Romania's cities, the countryside languishes."
rom.18.a:0 "Make promises to improve the quality of life of our rural base."
rom.18.b:0 "Slow steps towards economic modernization should be taken."
rom.18.c:0 "The life of the hardworking Romanian peasant should be being glorified, not reviled."
rom.18.e:0 "Propose Russian-style Five Year Plans to modernise the countryside."
rom.18.f:0 "Comprehensive universal education is the best way to modernise the country."

rom.19.t:0 "Strike at Muntenia Oil Refinery"
rom.19.d:0 "Romania has dealt with strikes intermittently the last half-decade now, but up until today legislation and tight regulations have stopped Oil Workers from striking, due to their importance to the national economy and electrical grid. \n\nHowever now, a combined alliance of radical, underground Worker's Unions have declared a general strike of the Oil wells & refineries of Eastern Wallachia, where over 80% of Romania's oil is sourced from, demanding improved conditions and the right to organise. \n\nThe news has sent urban Romania as a whole into a panic, and with factory owners and industrialists in particular petrified of a potential second wave of economic downturn depending on how long this goes on. This government has weathered many crises, but this very well may be the do-or-die moment for Maniu and his cabinet."
rom.19.a:0 "Surround the Refineries and starve them out."
rom.19.b:0 "Send in the army!"
rom.19.c:0 "Local Anti-Communist Paramilitaries break the strike themselves."
rom.19.e:0 "Cave to their demands."
rom.19.f:0 "Attempts to starve them out fail, with local villagers sneaking in food."
rom.19.g:0 "Infighting in the Liberal cabinet prevents any decisive action."

rom.20.t:0 "Iuliu Maniu assassinated"
rom.20.d:0 "Yesterday night, at 7PM while returning home from a dinner with colleagues at an upmarket restaurant in Bucharest, Prime Minister Maniu's car was pulled over by Leninist radicals disguised as policemen, who proceeded to murder the Prime Minister, shouting the apparent Bolshevik slogan 'Death to all those who stand in the way of the working people!'. One of the radicals was immediately murdered by the Prime Minister's bodyguard, another fled, and the third has been taken into custody by the Bucharest Police Department.\n\nThe country has broken out in a wave of shock, with absolute confusion reigning due to the lack of details. Almost all mainstream parties have launched a rhetorical assault on Bolshevist terrorism, while far-right elements, seizing on unverified claims of Jewish & Hungarian ancestry of the assassins, have launched a spree of retaliatory violence and pogroms across the country. \n\nIon Mihalache, Maniu's second, has been appointed temporary PM pending the outcome of the looming 1933 elections."
rom.20.a:0 "It is clear now, the NPP are the only sane option!"
rom.20.b:0 "The People's Party diavows such barbarity."
rom.20.c:0 "So much for the tolerant left!"
rom.20.e:0 "The capitalist pig deserved it."
rom.20.f:0 "The Social Democrats sends their condolences."
rom.20.g:0 "Confident from their unilateral handling of the Muntenia Strike, the Army launches a coup."

rom.21.t:0 "Liberal Victory"
rom.21.d:0 "After a fraught year, topped off with the assassination of Prime Minister Maniu, the Peasant's Party and other Liberal allies have managed to grip onto power, with a marginal decline in vote share. Mihalache has been officially sworn in and agreed upon by the Party to be Maniu's replacement, and now faces many difficulties ahead - but with a unified Liberal front behind him, galvanized after the trauma of Maniu's assassination, he may well be able to recover the country from the brink."
rom.21.a:0 "Huzzah!"

### Conservative Victory ###

rom.22.t:0 "Conservative Victory"
rom.22.d:0 "Tired of corrupt, incompetent and condescending Liberal rule, the people have voted in a clear alternative in the syncretic, politically fluid Conservative People's Party built almost entirely around populist War Hero Alexandru Averescu. Avarescu stands as unquestioned leader of his party, beloved by the popular masses, and what he lacks in concrete policy or principle he makes up for in his sheer fluidity. While almost all of what Romania has seen of Avarescu until now has been mere rhetoric, it is now time to see what he is truly made of."
rom.22.a:0 "Nihil Sine Deo!"

rom.33.t:0 "Alexandru Avarescu dies"
rom.33.d:0 "Passing peacefully in his sleep, Prime Minister Avarescu last night left this world for the next, bringing out the sorrow and gratitude of the nation. He is expected to be buried, as the war hero he was, in the Heroes Crypt in Mărăsti."
rom.33.a:0 "A great man!"

### Fascist Victory ###

rom.23.t:0 "Fascist Victory"
rom.23.d:0 "Spurred on by a fractured economy, divided country and an unstable election campaign, the people have entrusted the Conductor's Baton with a broad pan-Fascist coalition of right-wing, antisemetic, nationalist elements. This ragtag ministry is spearheaded by Căpitanul Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, enigmatic and fanatical leader of the ultraorthodox Iron Guard. Known as a man with singular purpose and an unbreakable will, having built his party from penniless university students up to now holding the reigns of the country. \n\nWhile Social Liberals and Leftists of every stripe are appalled by this development, many doubt the longevity of the government, with Codreanu's notoriously uncompromising personality now having to make do with both moderate members of his own party and his second-largest coalition partner, the Italian-inspired Fascio, unusually lead by a woman, author and nationalist intellectual Elena Bacaloglu."
rom.23.a:0 "Everything for the Country!"

rom.37.t:0 "Tensions in the Coalition"
rom.37.d:0 "Perhaps as many saw coming, the Fascist coalition government has already begun to demonstrate some friction between it's major components - chiefly the dominant Iron Guard party lead by Prime Minister Codreanu, and Foreign Minister Elena Bacaloglu's Fascio. \n\nThe Iron Guard build their ideology and plan for Romania around a deeply traditional brand of Orthodox Christianity and a 'Spiritual Rebirth', bereft of detailed policy on matters of state such as economics. By comparison, the more pragmatic Italian-inspired Fascio espouse a more secular revival of national pride and distinctly corporatist economic policies. Increasingly the two parties are clashing in the conference-room and in Parliament, with the Fascio accusing the Iron Guard of supporting wishy-washy, immaterial pursuits over concrete plans to reform the country, while the Iron Guard deride their 'baseless' ideology and continue to circumvent the normal means of state power by strengthening their own paramilitary apparatus."
rom.37.a:0 "This does not bode well."

rom.38.t:0 "Fascio launches coup attempt"
rom.38.d:0 "With tensions between Fascio and the Iron Guard at breaking point after a public spat in Parliament between Bacaloglu and Legionnaire Interior Minister Hora Simia, and the subsequent assassination of a Fascio regional governor, cooperation has broken down and the Fascio have decided to take matters into their own hands. \n\nMobilising their support among Bucharest university students and intellectuals, Fascio-loyal paramilitaries have bloodlessly seized control of Parliament, preventing Ministers from leaving, while a battle still now rages over the Radio Romania headquarters, from which Iron Guard loyalists are attempting to gather nationwide support for resistance against the coup. Meanwhile the search is on for Prime Minister Codreanu, who was not at his official residence or parliament, with Fascio members now raiding the houses of important party members and friends of the Capitanul to find him. With the streets of Bucharest now a battleground, how this will play out seems very much up in the air."
rom.38.a:0 "The Coup is put down with the mobilisation of loyal army regiments."
rom.38.b:0 "The Coup succeeds, with a new government announced on the radio and Codreanu placed under arrest."


### Leninist Victory ###

rom.24.t:0 "Leninist Victory"
rom.24.d:0 "In a truly unbelievable result that has left many wondering if they are still dreaming, a coalition of Marxists, Leninists, Socialists, Anarchists, Social Democrats, and Leftists of every stripe have come together to just scrape by a thin plurality in Parliament. \n\nCongratulations from across the country have been few and far between, with Liberals & Conservatives accusing foreign involvement and political intimidation, Fascists already brawling in the streets with these 'traitors to the country', and the Officer's Halls already full of murmurs of 'Coup, coup'. Only one thing seems to be for certain now - the relatively unknown Union leader Gheorghe Cristescu, who now finds himself at the helm of a deeply divied and incredulous Romania, certainly has his work cut out for him."
rom.24.a:0 "Workers of the world, unite!"

rom.48.t:0 "Reactionary Riots"
rom.48.d:0 "Following the election of the new and deeply unpopular Marxist government, street battles and a widespread breakdown in law and order has become the norm, but last night saw the most destructive wave of riots and pogroms yet, engulfing major cities across Romania from Constanta to Oradea, with incensed peasants and paramilitaries targeting ethnic minorities, Jews and alleged Socialists or supporters of the government. \n\nDawn has now broken, and the dust seems to have settled for the time being, this night being perhaps the last anguished scream of reactionary Romania."
rom.48.a:0 "They'll come around."

rom.49.t:0 "Minister assassinated!"
rom.49.d:0 "Late last night, Economic Minister Barbu Lazareanu - the man behind the government's recent policy of aggressive nationalisation of key industries - was shot and murdered at a speaking dinner by Theodor Zissu, a young man and son of A.L. Zissu, a prominent Romanian industrialist who was recently put out of business by the government's new policies. Immediately apprehended, the culprit professed a desire to save his country from 'Bolshevist ruin'. While the attack has devastated the government and it's supporters, it has both empowered and confused the far-right, who have glorified the killing but found themselves unable of what to make of the assassin's Jewish ancestry."
rom.49.a:0 "Capitalist Pigs!"

rom.50.t:0 "Civil War!"
rom.50.d:0 "Our move to abolish the monarchy has been the last straw for much of rural, conservative Romania and her more right-wing elements. Declaring a 'war of national liberation', General Ion Antonescu, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and other far-right political & military figures have established a rouge government in the northeast of the country based out of Chișinău, from where they seem poised to launch an attack on Bucharest with the aim of toppling our government. We are at war!"
rom.50.a:0 "Death to all those who stand in the way of liberation for the working people!"

rom.51.t:0 "New Promotions"
rom.51.d:0 "With much of the army, including an overwhelming majority of the officer corps having deserted in favour of the rebel Chișinău government, what remains of the Romanian Army has found itself worryingly short on officers. In response, a hastily-organised army committee has promoted some of the most loyal & skilled remaining officers of the Romanian Army to command positions so we stand a better chance of winning this war."
rom.51.a:0 "We'll take what we can get."

rom.52.t:0 "'Offer' from the Soviets"
rom.52.d:0 "We have recieved a communique from Moscow, 'offering' their 'support' against Antonescu's rebellion, and 'membership' in the Sovetsglas. While their support would be massively strategically important in the war against the rebel government, they have also demanded we relinquish occupied Alfold and Carpathia to Hungary and Slovakia. While those demands in of themselves may not be unreasonable, more skeptical members of our government have raised concerns that the Soviets are angling to subordinate Romania to be a Poland-style puppet-state, and furthermore permit Hungary to enforce their wider claims upon Transylvania on us."
rom.52.a:0 "Arm-in-arm we shall break the chains!"
rom.52.b:0 "The liberated Romania will not be anyone's slave!"

rom.53.t:0 "Intervene in Romanian Civil War"
rom.53.d:0 "Following the unexpected ascension to power of the Romanian Communist Party, tensions in the deeply reactionary and backwards country have boiled over following attempts by the new government to abolish the monarchy, with General Antonescu and Fascist leaders launching a rebellion in the northeast of the country, along our very own border. \n\nSome more hawkish members of our government have suggested we should act quickly to deal with this nearby conflict, to support our potential ideological allies in Romania, and secure disputed Hungarian & Slovak territory occupied by Romania."
rom.53.a:0 "We should move quickly to secure our interests in Romania."
rom.53.b:0 "This isn't of interest to us right now."

rom.54.t:0 "End of the Romanian Civil War"
rom.54.d:0 "With the end of the Romanian Civil War, and the Romanians in our debt for saving them from the reactionary hordes, it is time to reconstruct Romania as an effective ally and subordinate to the USSR. One issue raised by our allies and members of our government are remaining Russian, Hungarian and Polish claims on Romanian territory, which they argue would only be fair payment for our assistance."
rom.54.a:0 "Romania is more useful to us intact."
rom.54.b:0 "Russia & her allies will get their due!"

rom.55.t:0 "Soviets demand territory"
rom.55.d:0 "With the conclusion of the civil war, our new Soviet allies have seen fit to expand the initial territorial cessions granted to them upon our alliance, and have extended demands that we cede them Bessarabia, Transylvania to Hungary and Bukovina to Poland."
rom.55.a:0 "We have no choice."
rom.55.b:0 "Romania did not have her revolution just to be subordinates again."

rom.56.t:0 "Civil War Leaders Executed"
rom.56.d:0 "After a series of trials in Bucharest lasting just over two weeks, Ion Antonescu, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and high-level leaders of the counterrevolutionary rebellion that ravaged the country were convicted of treason and sentenced to death. A few days later Antonescu, Codreanu, and other key figures were executed by firing squad near Jilava."
rom.56.a:0 "No tears will be shed for them."

rom.57.t:0 "Flight of King Michael"
rom.57.d:0 "On holiday at the time in Transylvania, when Antonescu's Rebellion broke out following the Abolition of the Monarchy Act, the young ex-King was hastily taken to the rebel capital Chișinău, under the hope that his presence would grant legitimacy to the rebellion. Now that the tables have decisively turned against the rebels, Michael has been spirited away by his royal household, leaving from Constanta on a steamship bound for London, with the tacit approval of the Romanian Government."
rom.57.a:0 "And don't come back!"

### Social Democratic Victory ###

rom.25.t:0 "Social Democratic Victory"
rom.25.d:0 "Loosely banding together Democratic Socialists, Social Democratics, ethnic minority interest parties of every sort, and anyone else who would join up, a combined front of 'Moderate Left' parties motivated by social inequality and injustice, and galvanized together by the violence in Târgu Mures earlier this year, have just scraped into power by three seats in Parliament. \n\nThe now out-of-power Liberals behind Ion Mihalache have found the ideological insecurity and electoral baselessness of the coalition to be a potential way to regain lost political influence, proclaiming their support for the new government. Meanwhile, Conservatives, Fascists, Nationalists and all on the right-wing have reacted with horror and incredulity, seeing these results as the end point of a foreign, Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy to take over Romania. Corneliu Codreanu of the Iron Guard has pledged a campaign of violent resistance, and many seem to be falling behind him."
rom.25.a:0 "We will endure!"

rom.58.t:0 "Wave of Pogroms"
rom.58.d:0 "Coming almost as a physical, visceral rejection of the government's new policies to ameliorate rampant discrimination against Jews and ethnic minorities in Romania, a wave of pogroms has swept the countryside, prompting outrage and despair from the urban intellectuals, predominantly Jewish, German and Hungarian in ancestry behind the government's latest set of legislation."
rom.58.a:0 "Send in the Police to restore order."
rom.58.b:0 "Call for calm and reason."

rom.59.t:0 "Protests at Parliament!"
rom.59.d:0 "In an attempt to halt the implementation of the government's newly-introduced parliamentary seats for ethnic minorities, right-wing MPs and politicians have gathered at the entrance to the Parliament building in Bucharest and formed a blockade. Government MPs and particularly the ethnic minority members are now gathering outside, being prevented from entering to vote on new legislation or take their seats. While nobody has been hurt so far, frustrations are growing on both sides and escalation seems imminent. Nonetheless, this extralegal blocking of parliamentary procedure cannot be allowed to go on, and undermines the government's authority for every minute it continues."
rom.59.a:0 "Enlist the local police to break the blockade."
rom.59.b:0 "Simply hold Parliament on the lawn outside, we have the MPs."

rom.60.t:0 "Tensions Cool"
rom.60.d:0 ""
rom.60.a:0 "Excellent."

### Army Coup ###

rom.26.t:0 "Army breaks Muntenia Oil Strike"
rom.26.d:0 "Apparently incensed by the Liberal Government's lack of action over the Muntenia Oil Crisis, the Army in flagrant disregard for the principle of civilian rule over the military, have unilaterally decided to take action. Just as dawn broke this morning, about three hundred Romanian troops were deployed across the Muntenia Oilfields, and by noon had successfully broken the strike. In initial clashes it seems that at least a dozen strikers have died, along with two soldiers. \n\nGeneral Staff Officer Ion Antonescu who lead the operation has announced that the oilfields will resume work tomorrow, but has refused to comment on the notability of the Army's autonomous course of action."
rom.26.a:0 "We didn't order that!"

rom.27.t:0 "Army seizes power"
rom.27.d:0 "Following the assassination of Prime Minister Maniu, the Army lead by General Antonescu launched a coup, seizing control of key government offices in Bucharest and other major cities, taking over important government establishments and communications infrastructure, through which a temporary 'Government of National Restoration' was announced, as well as the indefinite postponing of the 1932 elections. \n\nMany have said this was long foreshadowed with the largely conservative and at time fascist-sympathetsing army's long--standing disagreements with the Liberal government, and more recently with their unilateral handling of the Muntenia Oil Strike. \n\nThe seizure of power and cancellation of the elections for the second year in a row has provoked outrage among the political mainstream, but many in the centre and the right of politics see this as a neccessary measure to preserve order following a traumatic last year." 
rom.27.a:0 "Order must be maintained." 

rom.28.t:0 "Pro-Democracy protests in Bucharest"
rom.28.d:0 "Scarcely a month after the establishment of the Government of National Restoration, the largest yet Pro-Democracy March in Bucharest has been organised, consisting of Liberals, Democratic Conservatives, Socialists and other anti-authoritarian fellow travellers. Only four days from now they are set to march through some of Bucharet's most visible boulevards and streets, before coming to the Parliament building - a point that many see as a potential cover for a counter-coup attempt. Simultaneous demonstrations in other large cities across Romania are also expected."
rom.28.a:0 "Clamp down, this cannot be allowed to go ahead."
rom.28.b:0 "Let them be, nothing good can come of suppressing this."

rom.29.t:0 "Bessarabian General Strike"
rom.29.d:0 "Following on from a wave of Pro-Democracy protests across the country, the worker's unions in Bessarabia have declared a general strike, halting all industry in the province. The Strike is backed up by many on the Left, including allegedly support from Bessarabia's substantial Ukrainian population, many of whom are members of the underground Leninist Vyzvolennia Party. Even moderate Conservatives however, are hesitant to throw their support behind such crypto-Bolshevist efforts."
rom.29.a:0 "Crack down!"
rom.29.b:0 "We'll wait them out."

rom.30.t:0 "New Elections held"
rom.30.d:0 "After finally declaring the situation stabilised enough to hold new elections, the Government of National Restoration has called new elections, making good on a promise for temporary rule. However, unexpectedly, the Army itself has constituted a political party for the regime, the similarly-named 'Government of National Restoration'. \n\nAmid widespread reports of intimidation, politicised use of state funding, and other electoral red flags, the Committee of National Restoration has formed a legal government in coalition with Conservative, Fascist and Paternalistic parties, with a 71% majority in Parliament. Ion Antonescu, while now legally Prime Minister, has eschewed the title for 'Conducator', similar nomenclature to that of the fascist Iron Guard, who he has now brought into government."
rom.30.a:0 "What a lucky result."

## Flavor Events ##
rom.31.t:0 "Arcul de Triumf"
rom.31.d:0 "Originally constructed as a hasty wooden frame for victorious Romanian troops in the 1878 War of Independence, the Arcul de Triumf which stands in northern Bucharest was rebuilt with a concrete skeleton and ornate, detailed sculptures in 1922 after the Great War, and now has entered it's third incarnation in a more sober Neoclassical design, hoped to stand the test of time more than previous iterations which rapidly decayed."
rom.31.a:0 "It was about time..."

rom.32.t:0 "Mausoleum of Mărăsesti"
rom.32.d:0 "Having taken fifteen years to build, the ornate, somber and incredible Mausoleum of Mărăsesti now stands completed near the Moldavian town of Mărăsesti, serving as a memorial for the Great War Battle of Mărăsesti, where over 27,000 Romanians died holding the town against a numerically superior German army, inflicting twice as many casualties on the German invaders. The battle is also notable for being where the 'Romanian Jeanne d'Arc' Ecaterina Teodoroiu was killed, a heroine of the Romanian Army in the Great War."
rom.32.a:0 "A true masterpiece."

rom.34.t:0 "Romanian Academy of Sciences Founded"
rom.34.d:0 "Dissatisfied with the lack of scientific focus in the Romanian Academy, a group of 26 breakaway scientists went to found a distinct Academy of Sciences, for the dissemination of research, academic discussion and providing awards for valuable research. It had ten sections, each with 12 members each; Mathematics and Astronomy, Physics, Chemistry, Biology comprising Zoology, Botany and Physiology, Applied Biology, Geology and Geography, Military Science, a 'Technical Section', Social and Economic Sciences, and finally a section of History and the Philosophy of Science, Organization and Education."
rom.34.a:0 "Hurrah!"

rom.35.t:0 "Copsa Mică works"
rom.35.d:0 "Funded by a joint Czecho-Romanian entrepreneurial effort, the Copsa Mică works began as a complex of munitions factories supported economically by producing carbon black from methane gas, and would go on to become a sprawling industrial complex in the heart of Transylvania.11"
rom.35.a:0 "Only good can come of this."

rom.36.t:0 "Viata Basarabiei"
rom.36.d:0 "Viata Basarabiei, 'Bessarabia's Life' is a Romanian-language literary and political magazine that begun as an adaptation of the Moldovan-based Viata Românească, capitalising on Bessarabia's surprisingly vibrant literary scene. However, the periodical began to take on a noticably regionalist political stance, purporting a seperate, Russophilic Bessarabian identity seen as superior to 'Romanianism'. While paper itself skirts the line between outright seperatist Moldovenism and a simply regionalist belief in Bessarabian uniqueness, it continues to make waves in Chisinău and beyond."
rom.36.a:0 "What fools."

ROM_SP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania at the dawn of the 1930s is a country paralysed by fear. The primary objective of Romanian foreign policy since independence, the unification of Greater Romania, has been achieved in the aftermath of the Great War. However now the country's effective encirclement by Communist powers puts all of that in jeopardy. Soviet intervention in the Hungarian-Romanian war prevented the deposition of the Leninist Kun regime, halting the Romanian advance at the banks of the Tisa river. An uneasy peace followed, leaving Romania in possession of Transcarpathia, and much of the Great Hungarian Plain, which remain under military governance to this day."
