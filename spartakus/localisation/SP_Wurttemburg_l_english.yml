### Focuses ###
WUR_doctrine_new:0 "Military Reform"
WUR_doctrine_new_desc:0 "With the death of Hans von Seeckt and the retirement of August von Mackensen, the Chief of General Staff has been embroiled in heated debate as to which military doctrine should be adopted. We should establish an impartial committee of military officers to oversee the adoption of new doctrine."
WUR_doctrine_great_war:0 "Squad Tactics"
WUR_doctrine_great_war_desc:0 "The intervention in the chaotic Chinese Civil War has reinforced among our officers, the importance of coordination within individual squads. We should integrate so called 'Gruppentaktiken' into our infantry training regime."
WUR_doctrine_great_war_2:0 "The modern Art of War"
WUR_doctrine_great_war_2_desc:0 "There is one book that every man who wants to become an officer in the army of the Reich must read - Clausewitz' 'The Art of War'. If we put our best military theorists on the subject, they can adapt the still applicable principles from the centuries-old book to the requirements of modern warfare."
WUR_doctrine_mobile:0 "Motorised Infiltration"
WUR_doctrine_mobile_desc:0 "While our military high command is divided on many subjects, they are united on one topic: They say that the possibilities that mass motorisation offers to infantry in warfare can to be exploited to win fast and decisive victories on an operational scale, hearkening back to the victory of 1870/71."
WUR_doctrine_mobile_2:0 "A new Doctrine"
WUR_doctrine_mobile_2_desc:0 "Some of the more radical innovators - Heinz von Guderian and Erich von Manstein, with others - in our military high command are lobbying for research into a totally new doctrine. They want to focus on the fast movement of armoured spearheads to break up solid fronts."
WUR_doctrine_mobile_2_prerequisite:0 "Either §YHeinz Guderian§! or §YErich von Manstein§! is the chief of staff."
WUR_doctrine_mobile_3:0 "Invest in Panzer Factories"
WUR_doctrine_mobile_3_desc:0 "With a little directed investment, we could raise productivity of our armour factories by quite a lot. Some of our more conservative-minded generals will not approve of this investment, though."

WUR_appeasement:0 "Appease the Masses"
WUR_appeasement_desc:0 "Rather than cracking down on these misfit socialists, we could instead get them to join our ranks, and end this crisis. Although such a move will be wildly unpopular with the right, in due time they will see it was the right decision."
WUR_counteracting:0 "Counteracting the Protests"
WUR_counteracting_desc:0 "Violently suppressing the reds would only be a waste of valuable men, something that is precious unfortunately in our rump state. Instead of a bloodbath, we should roll out our own Christian trade unions backed by the police."
WUR_pacification:0 "Pacify the Leaders"
WUR_pacification_desc:0 "Ending these protests will not be an easy task. Too much action and we risk falling apart. Not enough action and we risk the same. The alternative is to eliminate key leaders of the agitators, which will surely weaken the morale of these men and women."
WUR_outlaw_socialists:0 "Outlaw the Unions"
WUR_outlaw_socialists_desc:0 "These red agitators just will not stop! They have been allowed to operate too long, and now is the time we crack down and push them back to the little holes they came from!"
WUR_purge_socialists:0 "Purge the Socialists"
WUR_purge_socialists_desc:0 "Many of the moderates have suggested weak actions; bans, appeasement, reform. Now is the time to reject all that, and not give an inch to the socialist menace. Our men will storm their meeting centers and execute all who dare to don the red armband."
WUR_political_1:0 "The Darkest Day"
WUR_political_1_desc:0 "We were foolish to think we were immune to the red agitation. They seek to bring down our Kaiser once and for all and merge with the traitors to the North. We must decide which direction to take, and quickly."
WUR_dnvp2:0 "The New Structure"
WUR_dnvp2_desc:0 "The Old Guard wish to go back to the days of Prussian Constitutionalism, but it doesn't take a genius to know that is what got us in this situation in the first place. The New Guard of the DNVP will ensure the system is perfected."
WUR_dkp:0 "The Old Structure"
WUR_dkp_desc:0 "The New Guard of the DNVP wish to destroy our traditional Prussian ideals. The restored DKP will be a perfect compromise, and soon Germany will forget about this dark chapter of our history."
WUR_reform_bundesrat:0 "Reform the Bundesrat"
WUR_reform_bundesrat_desc:0 "After our hasty return to Wurttemburg, both Hindenburg and Luddendorf decided to abolish the Bundesrat, which represented the German states. Although it wouldn't have much use now, a return of this system would help gain some sympathies."
WUR_centralise:0 "Centralise the Parliament"
WUR_centralise_desc:0 "The country has functioned just fine without the Bundesrat and a strong Bundestag. It would be better to remain with the status quo, and think about potential reforms at a later date."
WUR_alliance:0 "An Alliance?"
WUR_alliance_desc:0 "As we lay in the middle of the political spectrum, it would be wise to take advantage of that by making an alliance with one of the other major parties, which would surely give us far more popularity among that group."
WUR_add_restrictions:0 "Add Restrictions"
WUR_add_restrictions_desc:0 "Normally most men over the age of 25 would be able to vote, however it would be wiser to add some restrictions to keep far left and far right agitators out of the government. Blacklisting members of certain groups from voting and increasing the voting age would surely help."
WUR_restore_vote:0 "Restore the Vote"
WUR_restore_vote_desc:0 "Our last election was in 1925, and remains the only election held since the restoration of 1920. It is time to return to the old voting system."

### Leader descriptions ###

POLITICS_WILHELM_II_DESC:0 "Wilhelm II von Hohenzollern, Emperor of Germany, has witnessed his Empire be torn apart by revolutionaries and the Western powers only a decade ago. First exiled to the Netherlands, he has found his way to exile in the Kingdom of Wurttemburg, a rump state which recognizes itself as a constituent of the mostly defunct German Empire. Wilhelm dreams of restoring his Empire, but with the French keeping watch and socialists surrounding him, such dreams may remain only dreams."

### Darkest Day ###

wur.2.t:0 "The Darkest Day"
wur.2.d:0 "On May 1st, 1932, the thirteenth anniversary of the uprising that toppled the Weimar Republic, small workers strikes on the streets of Stuttgart quickly grew far larger than what anyone could have expected. Thousands march with the red banner held high, aiming to end the German Empire and its decaying dynasty once and for all. The military is spread far too thin to respond to this threat immediately, and it seems the situation is only going to get worse. \n\nCould this mean the end of the Hohenzollern dynasty once and for all? Newspapers have already falsely reported the Kaiser's death. Regardless, the world will be watching closely."
wur.2.a:0 "Mein Gott!"

wur.3.t:0 "Riots in Stuttgart"
wur.3.d:0 "As expected, the strikes have progressively grown into full out riots. Businesses have been looted and armed militiants have occupied government buildings. The local garrison fears that the reds may converge on the Kaisers palace at any time. Preparations to evacuate have already begun."
wur.3.a:0 "How could this happen?"

wur.4.t:0 "The Kaiser Flees"
wur.4.d:0 "With the rebels closing in, the Kaiser has been safely evacuated from the city to a secure location in the countryside along with much of the cabinet. The country has been officially put into a state of emergency, and the government has ceased to function for the time being."
wur.4.a:0 "Heil im dir Siegerkranz?"

wur.5.t:0 "Freikorps Form"
wur.5.d:0 "Fourteen years ago, a group of disgruntled veterans known as the Freikorps were formed as a militia to combat both the socialist revolutionaries and the moderate republicans. Although they were ultimately defeated during the German Civil War, many right wing paramilitaries still go by the name Freikorps. The paramilitaries of the right wing parties in Wurttemburg have banded together to fight the left wing rebels once again."
wur.5.a:0 "You better win this time!"

wur.6.t:0 "The Army Reorganizes"
wur.6.d:0 "Our disgruntled army has been reorganized to march on Stuttgart and put down the riots. Many have fled across the border to Bavaria through the countryside."
wur.6.a:0 "Forwards men!"

wur.7.t:0 "The Army Marches into Stuttgart"
wur.7.d:0 "With both the army and the Freikorps united, they have marched on Stuttgart to crush the rebellion once and for all. The rebels, however, have grown much stronger than expected, having seized weapons caches and having received smuggled weaponry from the bordering socialist countries."
wur.7.a:0 "With the needed help of the Freikorps, the rebels are crushed!"
wur.7.b:0 "The rebels crush the Freikorps and rout the army, declaring the Free Union of Wurttemburg!"

wur.8.t:0 "The Freikorps Refuse to Stand Down"
wur.8.d:0 "Although a great victory has been won, the Freikorps have refused to stand down, pledging their allegiance to the right wing Deutschsozialistische Partei and the Alldeutscher Verband. Neither party has endorsed the Freikorps, nor have they requested them to stand down. Although the military command have offered their suggestions, the choice falls to the Kaiser."
wur.8.a:0 "The Kaiser contacts the Right Wing"
wur.8.b:0 "The Kaiser makes a speech to preserve the status quo"
wur.8.c:0 "The Kaiser contacts the Moderates"

wur.9.t:0 "The Right Wing"
wur.9.d:0 "To avoid conflict with the Freikorps, the Kaiser has met with the leaders of the right wing parties. Two parties are vying for power: the Deutschsozialistische Partei, a group of nationalists who identify as national syndicalists and the Alldeutscher Verband, a Pan-Germanist group that identifies closely with Italian Fascism. The Kaiser must choose wisely, and the moderates and the traditionalists will not be happy with this."
wur.9.a:0 "Vorwarts!"

wur.10.t:0 "The Kaisers Speech"
wur.10.d:0 "To avoid conflict with the Freikorps, the Kaiser has made a speech to the troubled peoples of Stuttgart. The reign of the DNVP has been narrowly preserved, though signs of a split within the party have already begun to show. Many have laid down their arms and returned home, however the threat is still alive and well elsewhere, and both the moderates and far right will not be happy with this."
wur.10.a:0 "Vorwarts!"

wur.11.t:0 "The Moderates"
wur.11.d:0 "To avoid conflict with the Freikorps, the Kaiser has met with leaders of the moderate parties. Two parties are vying for power: Zentrum, a conservative group that closely aligns with Catholicism and the Deutsche Demokratische Partei, a liberal, somewhat pacifist group formed during the Weimar Republic. The Kaiser must choose wisely."
wur.11.a:0 "Vorwarts!"

wur.12.t:0 "The Crisis Ends"
wur.12.d:0 "After weeks of uncertainty, the situation has finally calmed down. Although there are many threats elsewhere, the country is secure for the moment. The ruling party must now lead Wurttemburg into the future."
wur.12.a:0 "Finally!"
