  argentina.1.t:0 "The death of Uriburu"
  argentina.1.d:0 "Calamity has struck our nation, our president, José Félix Uriburu has unfortunately fallen to a long lasting illness, and the nations now lacks a head of state to guide it. We must resolve this situation soon if we do not wish the socialists fall upon us like starving vultures and destroy our nation. Under normal circumstances, Lisandro de La torre, our Vice-President, should be the next in line to guide our nation, but this are not normal circumstances. Many of Uriburu's close friends and advisors misstrust De La Torre, as he has shown left leaning ideas, and has cooperated with socialists and radicals in the past. The coalition is divided, as many members do not wish to go against the constitutional mandate, nor against Uriburu's will, who had named De La torre his vice-president, others fear stopping De La Torre from taking power will destabilize the nation, or worse, lead to him attempting to overthrow the government"
  argentina.1.a:0 "We do not wish to go against our constitutional mandate"
  argentina.1.b:0 "The consequenses outgrow the benefits. Stop De La Torre"
  argentina.2.t:0 "The presidential debate"
  argentina.2.d:0 "Lisandro de La Torre has been successfully blocked from taking power. While marching towards the Casa Rosada, he was stopped by a small group of soldiers and civilians who demanded his resignation. With the problem of De La Torre out of sight, we must now answer the important question of who should lead our nation. From Uriburu's cabinet, there are two men that currently dispute the position of successor. Matías Sanchez Sorondo, his interior minister, supportive to the idea of Hispanic Corporatism, who has the support from the various paramilitaries that integrate the Coalition and from many of Uriburu's advisors, and Carlos Ibarguren, Uriburu's Brother in Law, a great afficionate of Italian Fascism and the Catholic ideals. The succession debate does not only involve these two men, as some other pretenders from other factions have spoken against them. the most important of these is Agustín Pedro Justo, one of the leaders of the revolution, who has the support of the more liberal sectors of the coalition. Finally, there is the Liga Patriótica, whose leader, Manuel Carlés, has abandoned political life after the revolution, but many within the government, like Anchorena and Varela, wish his return to politics, and claim he should be the one to save Argentina from anarchy, as he had already done in 1919. With a power struggle of this magnitude. How could Argentina avoid its downfall?
  argentina.2.a:0 "Matías Sanchez Sorondo is chosen"
  argentina.2.b:0 "Carlos Ibarguren is chosen"
  argentina.2.c:0 "Agustín Justo is chosen"
  argentina.2.e:0 "Manuel Carlés is chosen"
  argentina.3.t:0 "De La Torre is arrested"
  argentina.3.d:0 "Lisandro de La Torre, after being stopped from taking power by the Coalition, has not stopped his political manouvering. Yesterday, in Rosario, a group of police officers broke into his house, where a meeting was taking place, with the objective of overethrowing the government./nWhen the police broke into the house, De La Torre attempted to shoot the chief of Police, Eduardo Paganinni, but fortunately failed and was arrested. He will be sent to life imprisionment in Martín García, alongside his co-conspirators Antonio De Tomasi, Enzo Bordabehere, Atilio Cattaneo, Severo Toranzzo and Francisco Bosch"
  argentina.3.a:0 "Send our congratulations to Paganini"
  argentina.4.t:0 "A rejected proposal"
  argentina.4.d:0 "When asked by Uriburu's advisors to go back to his previous political life and take power, Carlés gave a negative response, claiming that his time had passed, and that he did not want to lead the nation, as the League was made to defend Argentina, which id did not need to at the moment, and not to lead it. With the gap left by Carlés, and not wishing to support either Sanchez Sorondo or Ibarguren, many of Carlés's supporters turned to Héctor Benigno Varela, the hero of the Patagonian revolt, while others had turned to Justo, saying that supporting Varela would be against Carlés's wish"
  argentina.4.a:0 "Varela will save us from disaster"
  argentina.4.b:0 "The league was never made to rule"
  argentina.5.t:0 "A Vice-President for De La Torre"

  argentina.6.c:0 "Our Defence minister will fullfil that Role"
  argentina.7.t:0 "Our Foreign Minister"
  argentina.7.d:0 "With our Interior situation somehow stabilized, we now turn towards our foreign affairs. While Bosch has proven himself to be a capable minister, his close relation to the banks and the Nationalist faction makes him undesirable to the Falangists. They propose, instead, to name Atilio Maini, a hardline catholic. We can also try to gain support from the Democrats and name Carlos Saavedra Lamas into office, but we do not know how will the other factions take this"
  argentina.7.a:0 "Please the Nationals, mantain Bosch as Minister"
  argentina.7.b:0 "Please the Falangists, Maini will be our Chancellor"

  argentina.8.d:0 "Our last decision regards the economic direction of our nation. To take up our nation from the disaster of Yrigoyen, the Nationals wat us to mantain Varela as minister, but he is not trusted by either the president nor his advisors, who instead suggest to name Luis Cerruti, a National Syndicalist, or Alfredo Bunge, relative of the Bunge family, both of whom have very different plans regarding our economic recovery"
