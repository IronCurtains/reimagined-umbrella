  argentina.1.t:0 "The death of Uriburu"
  argentina.1.d:0 "Calamity has struck our nation, our president, José Félix Uriburu has unfortunately fallen to a long lasting illness, and the nations now lacks a head of state to guide it. We must resolve this situation soon if we do not wish the socialists fall upon us like starving vultures and destroy our nation. Under normal circumstances, Lisandro de La torre, our Vice-President, should be the next in line to guide our nation, but this are not normal circumstances. Many of Uriburu's close friends and advisors misstrust De La Torre, as he has shown left leaning ideas, and has cooperated with socialists and radicals in the past. The coalition is divided, as many members do not wish to go against the constitutional mandate, nor against Uriburu's will, who had named De La torre his vice-president, others fear stopping De La Torre from taking power will destabilize the nation, or worse, lead to him attempting to overthrow the government"

  argentina.2.d:0 "Lisandro de La Torre has been successfully blocked from taking power. While marching towards the Casa Rosada, he was stopped by a small group of soldiers and civilians who demanded his resignation. With the problem of De La Torre out of sight, we must now answer the important question of who should lead our nation. From Uriburu's cabinet, there are two men that currently dispute the position of successor. Matías Sanchez Sorondo, his interior minister, supportive to the idea of Hispanic Corporatism, who has the support from the various paramilitaries that integrate the Coalition and from many of Uriburu's advisors, and Carlos Ibarguren, Uriburu's Brother in Law, a great afficionate of Italian Fascism and the Catholic ideals. The succession debate does not only involve these two men, as some other pretenders from other factions have spoken against them. the most important of these is Agustín Pedro Justo, one of the leaders of the revolution, who has the support of the more liberal sectors of the coalition. Finally, there is the Liga Patriótica, whose leader, Manuel Carlés, has abandoned political life after the revolution, but many within the government, like Anchorena and Varela, wish his return to politics, and claim he should be the one to save Argentina from anarchy, as he had already done in 1919. With a power struggle of this magnitude. How could Argentina avoid its downfall?"

De La Torre has been giving speeches in support of our economic independence and has been encouraging businessmen to invest in our national industry. Yesterday, a visit was scheduled to the city of Rosario, where he will give a speech in a newly opened Orbis factory. \nDe La Torre arrived today near noon, and while he was walking towards the factory, he was approached by a young man wearing a brown trench coat."
