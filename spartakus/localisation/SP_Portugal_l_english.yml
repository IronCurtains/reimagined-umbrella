por.1.t:0 "The Republic of Portugal"
por.1.d:0 "After a disastrous military showing in the Great War and the crushing defeats in Mozambique without any significant territorial gain, the Portuguese Republic was brought to the brink of collapse by 1919. The government had experienced the same humiliation and ineffectiveness that ended the Kingdom of Portugal less than a decade earlier, and it became clear that much of the country had begun to reconsider the Republican Revolution when pro-Monarchist militias seized the north in the first revolt. The army reluctantly put down the rebellion, however many of its leaders were let free because of their status as war heroes and icons. \n\nHowever, with much of Europe succumbing to socialist revolutions in the 1920s, tensions between the far right and far left in Portugal skyrocketed, and the moderate Republican government found itself becoming increasingly alienated among the populace. These tensions continued to boil as the government slowly collapsed and the economy with it. The military attempted to execute a coup in 1926, however the strong left wing supported the Republican government and the coup was only narrowly defeated. The government pursued the conspirators, whom many fled across the border to Spain or to the north where the stronger right wing base sheltered them. Despite the coup being defeated, the Republic continued its downward spiral as moderate leaders found their attempts to keep the left wing coalition which had saved the republic from consolidating power. \n\nThese attempts failed, however, when the Revolução Rosa of October 1931 overthrew the government relatively peacefully in Lisbon, the more rural right wing leaning north was quick to oppose this move, and the city of Porto erupted in a full out rebellion, with barricades being erected on every street manned by man and women alike. However, the government in the south had found other issues, such as an embargo by both Spain and the United Kingdom. This delayed the response to the rebellion in the north, and the rebels declared the republic defunct and illegitimate, proclaiming the Kingdom of Portugal in its place once again. However, the movement was quick to spread across the countryside, and enjoyed the support of its neighbors. British support ensured that the overseas territories of Portugal came under the control of the new monarchy, and Manuel II officially endorsed the revolt in November, returning to Portugal through Spain in November. \n\nIt is now the start of 1932, and the few months of small skirmishes have begun to show cracks as the conflict evolves further into a Civil War. No matter which side emerges victorious, no one can doubt that this period will have a significant impact on the future of Portugal."

Although this wouldn't usually be of much concern, thousands of forces have been reported to be moving to reinforce the Monarchist rebels. It is unclear what this will mean."
