por.1.t:0 "The Republic of Portugal"
por.1.d:0 "After a disastrous military showing in the Great War and the crushing defeats in Mozambique without any significant territorial gain, the Portuguese Republic was brought to the brink of collapse by 1919. The government had experienced the same humiliation and ineffectiveness that ended the Kingdom of Portugal less than a decade earlier, and it became clear that much of the country had begun to reconsider the Republican Revolution when pro-Monarchist militias seized the north in the first revolt. The army reluctantly put down the rebellion, however many of its leaders were let free because of their status as war heroes and icons. \n\nHowever, with much of Europe succumbing to socialist revolutions in the 1920s, tensions between the far right and far left in Portugal skyrocketed, and the moderate Republican government found itself becoming increasingly alienated among the populace. These tensions continued to boil as the government slowly collapsed and the economy with it. The military attempted to execute a coup in 1926, however the strong left wing supported the Republican government and the coup was only narrowly defeated. The government pursued the conspirators, whom many fled across the border to Spain or to the north where the stronger right wing base sheltered them. Despite the coup being defeated, the Republic continued its downward spiral as moderate leaders found their attempts to keep the left wing coalition which had saved the republic from consolidating power. \n\nThese attempts failed, however, when the Revolução Rosa of October 1931 overthrew the government relatively peacefully in Lisbon, the more rural right wing leaning north was quick to oppose this move, and the city of Porto erupted in a full out rebellion, with barricades being erected on every street manned by man and women alike. However, the government in the south had found other issues, such as an embargo by both Spain and the United Kingdom. This delayed the response to the rebellion in the north, and the rebels declared the republic defunct and illegitimate, proclaiming the Kingdom of Portugal in its place once again. However, the movement was quick to spread across the countryside, and enjoyed the support of its neighbors. British support ensured that the overseas territories of Portugal came under the control of the new monarchy, and Manuel II officially endorsed the revolt in November, returning to Portugal through Spain in November. \n\nIt is now the start of 1932, and the few months of small skirmishes have begun to show cracks as the conflict evolves further into a Civil War. No matter which side emerges victorious, no one can doubt that this period will have a significant impact on the future of Portugal."
por.1.a:0 "Revolução!"

por.2.t:0 "Skirmish at Coimbra"
por.2.d:0 "After months of minor skirmishes that have only ended in stalemate, Monarchist forces have converged on the city of Coimbra near the de facto 'front line'. Although this wouldn't usually be of much concern, thousands of forces have been reported to be moving to reinforce the Monarchist rebels. It is unclear what this will mean."
por.2.a:0 "Push them back!"

por.3.t:0 "The Monarchists Push Back!"
por.3.d:0 "In the largest battle yet of this revolt, Monarchist rebel forces have assaulted Coimbra by the thousands. Although they have been repelled, reports have come in of further skirmishes along the whole line, and it seems likely that this will be the start of full out hostilities."
por.3.a:0 "Now is the time!"

por.4.t:0 "Victory!"
por.4.d:0 "The countryside is devastated, our people lie sick, dying and heartbroken, but it is finally over. The republic has been secured, and the revolution with it. While the times ahead may be even harder, we can only look forwards!"
por.4.a:0 "For the people!"

por.5.t:0 "A Coup Attempt!"
por.5.d:0 "Although the revolution has gloriously succeeded, not all within the Revolutionary Committee agree with the plans ahead. The minority faction, the Portugese Communist Party, has stormed into the building and has attempted to seize power, backed by their paramilitaries."

por.5.b:0 "The Coup Succeeds!"

por.6.t:0 "Communist Takeover"
por.6.d:0 "Following a successful seizure of power, the Portugese Communist Party has been able to use scare tactics to win over the support of much of the Committee. It is seems likely that the party will rule with an iron fist."
por.6.a:0 "Interesting."

por.7.t:0 "The Great Purge"
por.7.d:0 "At exactly 8:27 AM today, the nationalized paramilitaries of the Portugese Communist Party marched into the Committee building in Lisbon and arrested every non-party member, declaring them traitors against the state who would be recieving a trial to determine their fate. These trials are, of course, show trials, and the outcome will be decided by the upper leadership of the PCP."
por.7.a:0 "You cannot run now!"

por.8.t:0 "The Great Purge - Trial of the Moderates"
por.8.d:0 "From 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM today, all members of the active moderate parties of the PLR, the PRP and the PD were put on quick trials who's outcomes were predetermined."

por.9.t:0 "The Great Purge - Trial of the Partido Reformista"
por.9.d:0 "From 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM today, all members of the Democratic Socialists of the Partido Reformista were put on quick trials who's outcomes were predetermined."
por.9.a:0 "Moderates in disguise! Guilty!"
por.9.b:0 "You are wasting my time. Move on!"
por.9.c:0 "The moderates were enough. End this madness!"

por.10.t:0 "The Great Purge - Trial of the Partido Socialista"
por.10.d:0 "From 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM today, all members of the Revolutionary Socialists of the Partido Socialista were put on quick trials who's outcomes were predetermined."
por.10.a:0 "You have too much power! Guilty!"
por.10.b:0 "They aren't the real enemy. Move on!"
por.10.c:0 "The revolution could not have been won without them. End this now!"

por.11.t:0 "The Great Purge - Trial of the P.R.E.D."
por.11.d:0 "From 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM today, all members of the Libertarian Marxists of the Partido Republicano da Esquerda Democrática were put on quick trials who's outcomes were predetermined."
por.11.a:0 "They are our natural enemies! Guilty!"
por.11.b:0 "They aren't worth the time and effort. Move on!"
por.11.c:0 "They are just like us. End this useless trial!"

por.12.t:0 "The Great Purge - Trial of the 'Disloyals'"
por.12.d:0 "From 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM today, a group of members of our own party who have been considered disloyal without much evidence were put on quick trials who's outcomes were predetermined."
por.12.a:0 "I just know they are plotting something behind my back! Guilty!"
por.12.b:0 "What is this? Prosecuting our own party members? Erase all records of this incident!"

por.13.t:0 "The Great Purge - Trials Completed"
por.13.d:0 "After months of executions, imprisonments, bans and raids the so called 'Great Purge of Portugal' has been completed. The country will need a long time to recover from this."
por.13.a:0 "It was all worth it. Trust me!"

por.14.t:0 "Police Deployment to the North"
por.14.d:0 "It has been some time since the revolution, but various bombings and attacks have dealt major blows to our economy, stability and our population. Giving up power is obviously not an option, and it would be preferable to deploy police to the northern part of our country. The question is, should this be permanent or temporary?"
por.14.a:0 "They will never give up. Deploy indefinitely!"
por.14.b:0 "I am sure a show of force will get them to stop. Half a year and they leave."
