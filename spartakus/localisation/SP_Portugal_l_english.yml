POR_communist_coup:0 "Communist Coup"
POR_communist_coup_desc:0 "Our fellow socialists just didn't understand how the party should function. They did not believe in the true ways of a Vanguard, and now that we have taken power, it is time to establish such a strucure"
POR_collectivization:0 "Collectivization"
POR_collectivization_desc:0 "Our farms shall be reorganized to be under state control in order to set a standard for their efficiency and output. This could cause some other unintended consequences, but it is worth for the revolution, right?"

POR_outlaw_moderates:0 "Crack Down on Moderates"
POR_outlaw_moderates_desc:0 "While moderate elements were certainly helpful in executing the revolution, past events have shown they cannot be trusted in the long term. It would be best to eliminate them before they can organize against us."
POR_mandatory_youth_service:0 "Mandatory Youth Service"
POR_mandatory_youth_service_desc:0 "It isn't enough to simply teach our youths the ways of the revolution. Instead, we must ensure they are disciplined and ready to shed their own blood to secure our safety."
POR_integrate_paramilitaries:0 "Integrate Paramilitaries"
POR_integrate_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Similar to trade unions, the paramilitaries established during the Civil War are no longer of any use, and could ultimately just prove to be a nusiance in the future. It would be best to nationalize them."

POR_ban_republican_parties_desc:0 "With our ultimate plans being to establish a Commune, it would make sense to cut down on the amount of supporters of retaining the Republic. It only takes a simple ban."

POR_one_country_desc:0 "It is silly to suggest Portugal is anything but one, united nation with a common goal - the liberation of the working class. There is no need for dividing up the country in the name of 'democracy', as it simply is redundant when considering our end goals."

POR_deploy_police_desc:0 "We can not hope to win over the lost souls who dared to support the reactionary rebellion in the north. It would be best to deploy loyal police units who will deal with these threats with any level of force needed."

POR_centralized_rulership_desc:0 "While many cities and areas enjoy a certain degree of autonomy, and some parties, such as the Intrgalists, see it as a good thing, it's abundantly clear that a more direct brand of leadership is required within our great Realm."

POR_reconcile_moderates_desc:0 "Many of those on the moderate wing were content with our rise to power, and although they do not fit well within the revolution, it would be unwise to purge them as some have suggested.

POR_revolutionary_propaganda_desc:0 "Some moderate socialists and fringe Leninist elements still doubt the long term success of our form of revolution. Some crafty words and mandated schooling programs would help that."
POR_paramilitary_expansion:0 "Paramilitary Expansion"
POR_paramilitary_expansion_desc:0 "Much of the military unfortunately defected to the monarchy following the revolution, however their archaic ways proved ineffective against the hastily established Republican Brigades.

POR_officialize_committee:0 "Officialize the Committee"
POR_officialize_committees_desc:0 "Although the revolutionary committee was established as a temporary measure to guide our people through troubled times, it has proved to be a proper unifying force. Officializing its structure would be central to completing the revolution."
POR_headless_state:0 "A Headless State"
POR_headless_state_desc:0 "A revolutionary state can not truly label itself revolutionary if it rules through the standard authoritarian ways of reactionaries and capitalists.

POR_local_committees:0 "Establish Local Committees"
POR_local_committees_desc:0 "Each administrative region will have its own directly elected committee made of local supporters of the revolution. The government and the party should be a guide for the revolution, not a vanguard."

POR_punish_traitors_desc:0 "Despite our best effort, rebels within Mozambique have continued to exist and resent our glorious kingdom.

We must make an example of them and all those who would dare preach disloyalty towards the Kingdom and barbarism."
POR_imperio:0 "Ultramarine Effort"
POR_imperio_desc:0 "Our overseas provinces, while a centrepiece of the Restored Government, still lag behind in many ways when compared to the mainland and are, in many ways, threatened by those who envy what Portugal has done for her people.

POR_enforce_colonial_act:0 "Enforce the Colonial Act"
POR_enforce_colonial_act_desc:0 "While groundbreaking legislation has been approved in the past decades, the laws have not been enforced within our overseas provinces. We mustn't allow complacency to take hold; laws are made to be enforced and we shall enforce them!"
POR_protect_mozambique:0 "Protect Mozambique"
POR_protect_mozambique_desc:0 "According to our top military experts, the best approach in defending Mozambique would be the forfeiture of its northern and unruly region, thereby establishing a safe perimeter within the Zambeze. Following this plan will help significantly improve our capacity to fend off aggression in Mozambique."

POR_modernized_administators_desc:0 "Most of their colonial administrators, when granted their posts, sought an easy, laid back assignment within the tropics. It is time to replace them with new, energetic youth who will be engaged and ready to carry out our colonial mission."
POR_academia_imperial:0 "Academia Imperial"
POR_academia_imperial_desc:0 "The greatest upside to investing in local talent within our empire is the fact that we can consolidate brilliant minds and use their efforts to modernise Portugal."
POR_casa_dos_estudantes_do_imperio:0 "Casa dos Estudantes do Império"
POR_casa_dos_estudantes_do_imperio_desc:0 "A formal house for students from our overseas provinces, the Home of the Students of the Empire is now be a beacon of pride and efficiency. This investment in academia will surely have more... practical uses for our government, as well."

POR_macau:0 "Protect and Develop Macau"
POR_macau_desc:0 "Macau is a crown jewel of the empire, envied by the Chinese because of its prosperity. However, it is also very far away from the Portugal. This means that, in the case of an attack, the province would have to hold on without support. To make matters worse, the government’s hold on the province is also very poor. In light of this information, we must prepare initiatives to defend and develop Macau."
POR_goa:0 "Defend the State of India"
POR_goa_desc:0 "The State of India, once safely protected due to the British control of the Indian subcontinent, is continually at risk of being attacked by either the Syndicalists in the east or the treacherous Princes in the south.

POR_winds_of_change:0 "The Winds of Change"

POR_grande_armada:0 "A Grande Armada"
POR_grande_armada_desc:0 "Possessing a carrier fleet is more than having a few airplanes at sea; it is the possibility of power projection, both aerially and navally, and controlling the naval battlefield. Our battleships and escorts, which will defend our carriers, will rule the waves as the nation of Dom Henrique once did many years ago."
POR_the_fleet_of_the_empire:0 "The Imperial Navy"
POR_the_fleet_of_the_empire_desc:0 "Establishing empire wide naval production standards and procedures will be a costly effort, but will most certainly pay off in the long run; The faster and more efficient our shipyards are, the sooner we can wrest absolute control of the seas!"

POR_backfoot_armada:0 "A Backfoot Armada"

POR_raiding_squads:0 "Planning for Asymmetrical Warfare"
POR_raiding_squads_desc:0 "Planning a war against the world’s biggest navy is not, by any means, an easily accomplished task. It will require much effort and calculation with our allies, admirals, and seamen. However, the tactics we use to deal with the War at Sea will certainly be crucial."
POR_submarines:0 "Hunting Teams"
POR_submarines_desc:0 "One of the most crucial aspects of a raiding navy is operational autonomy and co-operation between the ships within the fleet.

POR_ubarcos:0 "Imperial Submarine Force"

As Aetius once did, we shattered the illusion of Hunnic invincibility, and people around the world will honour with us the heroes in our struggle! Não Passarão! Angola é Portugal!"
POR_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward our Loyal Subjects"
POR_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "We often see the true mettle of a vassal when his liege is on the edge of a knife. Risking everything, many who could have been complacent fought for us. Some out of genuine loyalty, others for the thrill of battle, and some simply to prevent the alternative: being ruled by the Butcher of Mahenge, who sees all non-Germans as little more than beasts of Burden. All will have their loyalty rewarded!"

POR_zambia_e_nossa_desc:0 "Because of their thirst for earthly riches, the Germans have completely failed in their duty.

We can capitalise upon this opportunity and expand our empire, which will see the unification of our African provinces!"
POR_pinko:0 "The Pink Map"
POR_pinko_desc:0 "Because of the anarchy that has taken ahold of Africa, we may finally achieve the old goal of the Pink Map and exert control over vast swathes of land between Angola and Mozambique.

POR_dockyard2:0 "Dockyard Renewal"

por.1.t:0 "The Republic of Portugal"
por.1.d:0 "After a disastrous military showing in the Great War and the crushing defeats in Mozambique without any significant territorial gain, the Portugese Republic was brought to the brink of collapse by 1919. The government had experienced the same humiliation and ineffectiveness that ended the Kingdom of Portugal less than a decade earlier, and it became clear that much of the country had begun to reconsider the Republican Revolution when pro-Monarchist militias seized the north in the first revolt. The army reluctantly put down the rebellion, however many of its leaders were let free because of their status as war heroes and icons. \n\nHowever, with much of Europe succumbing to socialist revolutions in the 1920s, tensions between the far right and far left in Portugal skyrocketed, and the moderate Republican government found itself becoming increasingly alienated among the populace. These tensions continued to boil as the government slowly collapsed and the economy with it. The military attempted to execute a coup in 1926, however the strong left wing supported the Republican government and the coup was only narrowly defeated. The government pursued the conspirators, whom many fled across the border to Spain or to the north where the stronger right wing base sheltered them. Despite the coup being defeated, the Republic continued its downward spiral as moderate leaders found their attempts to keep the left wing coalition which had saved the republic from consolidating power. \n\nThese attempts failed, however, when the Revolução Rosa of October 1931 overthrew the government relatively peacefully in Lisbon, the more rural right wing leaning north was quick to oppose this move, and the city of Porto erupted in a full out rebellion, with barricades being erected on every street manned by man and women alike. However, the government in the south had found other issues, such as an embargo by both Spain and the United Kingdom. This delayed the response to the rebellion in the north, and the rebels declared the republic defunct and illegitimate, proclaiming the Kingdom of Portugal in its place once again. However, the movement was quick to spread across the countryside, and enjoyed the support of its neighbors. British support ensured that the overseas territories of Portugal came under the control of the new monarchy, and Manuel II officially endorsed the revolt in November, returning to Portugal through Spain in November. \n\nIt is now the start of 1932, and the few months of small skirmishes have begun to show cracks as the conflict evolves further into a Civil War. No matter which side emerges victorious, no one can doubt that this period will have a significant impact on the future of Portugal."
