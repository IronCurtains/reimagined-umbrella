ustates.1.t:0 "The 1932 Presidential Election"
ustates.1.d:0 "In what seemed to be a standard election year, things have taken a radical turn, with the Democratic Party, the Republican Party and a resurgent Progressive Party neck and neck in what seemed like a secure election for the sitting Republicans. The sudden crash of the stock market after what seemed like nearly a decade of prosperity and stability has surely contributed to the radicalization of this election. Regardless, the results are in, and the winner is..."

### Focuses - Presidents ###
USA_1936_election:0 "The 1936 Election"
USA_1936_election_desc:0 "The 1936 elections are the most ideological fraught elections in US history to date. Syndicalists and Nationalists, Republicans and Democrats all battle it out at the ballot box to see who will become the President of the United States of America. In the end though only one can be president."
USA_president_reed:0 "President Reed"
USA_president_reed_desc:0 "Against even the Combined Syndicates' wildest hopes, Jack Reed has been elected as the 31st president of the United States. His victory shocks not just America but the whole world. The syndicalists and their allies are jubilant at his success, while shouts of Red Traitor erupt throughout the country from those in the centre and the right galvanising them already against him. This most unexpected outcome seems to be setting the US on the path of gradual democratic socialism, that is if they can avoid any conflicts."
USA_labor_relations_act:0 "Labour-Relations Act"
USA_labor_relations_act_desc:0 "One of Reed's first acts as President is to push for the Labour-Relations Act. The act would help guarantee the rights of Unions from Collective Bargaining to Strike Action. This Act has surprisingly quite bit more support, particularly from the progressive wings of the Democrats and Republican. The conservatives in Congress however decry it as destroying American Capitalism."
USA_workers_security:0 "Syndicalist Social Security"
USA_workers_security_desc:0 "After the passage of the Labour-Relations Act in Congress, Jack Reed has set his sight on creating social security for all Americans. In contrast to the Labour-Relations Act, this has meet with criticism by even some of the progressive wings of the Democratic and Republican parties, still there is plenty of support for the Act that has already been dubbed, Syndicalist Social Security."
USA_resource_nationalization:0 "Resource Nationalisation Act"
USA_resource_nationalization_desc:0 "After the Passage of the Social Security Act, Reed has set his sight on nationalising the resources of America for Americans. However the resources nationalisation act has already met with stiff resistance by some and out right hostility from others. Reed and the syndicalists are determined to push it through though..."
USA_president_long:0 "President Long"
USA_president_long_desc:0 "Against all odds, Huey Long has been elected the 31st president of the United States. The Southern Demagogue is feared by his opponents but beloved by the rural poor and a significant portion of the disillusioned former-progressives of the middle class. He promises the world to his followers and shows little regard for the Constitution, but that is apparently enough to win election."
USA_long_farmer_relief:0 "Farmer Relief act"
USA_long_farmer_relief_desc:0 "One of the first acts that Long wishes to push through Congress is a farmer relief bill that would help the farmers throughout the country. The Syndicalists throughout the country counter that this reform doesn't go far enough while conservatives counter it goes to far. Yet despite this, it seems to be rather popular throughout the country."
USA_infastructure_building:0 "Long's Tariffs"

USA_expand_the_fbi:0 "Expand the FBI"
USA_expand_the_fbi_desc:0 "J. Edgar Hoover has approached Garner seeking to have more funding and support for the FBI.

USA_alien_sedition_acts:0 "Espionage and Sedition Act"
USA_alien_sedition_acts_desc:0 "Garner and Congress are active to punish all those who would rebel against the United States. With this new bill, dissent and even significant civilian support for rebel groups is punishable as sedition and possibly treason, and the punishments are harsh. This is strongly opposed by the CSA and American First within Congress, however the times require such a move."
USA_return_to_normalcy:0 "Banking Reform Act"
USA_return_to_normalcy_desc:0 "One of the acts that Garner embarked on was the reform of the Banking system. With the Depression still dragging on, some reform to the economy was needed to drag the economy back to some sort of healthy status."
USA_radical_centrism:0 "Defend the Status Quo"

USA_malice_chairty:0 "Pass the Economic Relief Act"
USA_malice_chairty_desc:0 "One of the first acts Curtis has as President is to address the Great Depression. The Economic Relief Act which was a policy he helped organise as Vice-President is given both new life and strength to address the Depression and get America back on her feet."
USA_support_aclu:0 "Pass the Civil Liberties Act"
USA_support_aclu_desc:0 "As President Curtis takes office he gives a stirring speech over the radio to the whole nation. Addressing the political conflict he says that the guiding ideal for his administration will be malice towards none and charity towards all. To that end he passes the Civil Liberties act to help safeguard Freedom and Liberty in America. A token gesture for the most part, but one that might just save America."
USA_banking_act:0 "Pass the Infrastructure bill"
USA_banking_act_desc:0 "To help get Americans back to work and improve the economy, Curtis has put forth to Congress an Infrastructure bill that would greatly improve the infrastructure throughout the country. It will take time to complete but the work will help America get back on her feet."
