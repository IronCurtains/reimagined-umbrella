ustates.1.t:0 "The 1932 Presidential Election"
ustates.1.d:0 "In what seemed to be a standard election year, things have taken a radical turn, with the Democratic Party, the Republican Party and a resurgent Progressive Party neck and neck in what seemed like a secure election for the sitting Republicans. The sudden crash of the stock market after what seemed like nearly a decade of prosperity and stability has surely contributed to the radicalization of this election. Regardless, the results are in, and the winner is..."

USA_booming_economy:0 "Booming Economy"
USA_booming_economy_desc:0 "Despite hardships elsewhere in the world and various issues with workers strikes, our economy has reached levels never seen before. Our isolationist and protectionist market prevented our country from being negatively affected by the London Stock Market crash in 1929. However, many warn that this abnormal boom could be the calm before the storm. Lets hope they are wrong..."

USA_tariff_act:0 "Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act"
USA_tariff_act_desc:0 "The Tariff Act of 1930, commonly known as the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, is a protectionist trade policy that places tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods. Economic analysts warn that these tariffs were unnecessary considering the booming economy, and the gradual retaliatory tariffs by our trade partners may have some unexpected consequences."

USA_impending_drought:0 "Impending Drought"
USA_impending_drought_desc:0 "§RNot taking proper precautions quick enough could lead to a major disaster.\n§!The Midwest throughout the 1920's experienced unusually rich weather with perfect rainfall and relatively moderate winter weather. However, in the summer of 1930, much of the midwest experienced extremely dry, hot weather that resulted in much of the rich soil turning to dust. 1931 saw similar conditions, and experts warn this could turn into a full blown agricultural crisis."

USA_neutrality_movement:0 "Neutrality Movement"
USA_neutrality_movement_desc:0 "We shed the blood of over 100,000 good men during the Great War, and achieved almost none of the Fourteen Points that President Woodrow Wilson created to rebuild the world after the war. He failed to establish the United States as a world power, and the idea of a League of Nations was thrown out entirely. Over a decade later, and our people are still extremely unwilling to engage in any sort of conflict overseas."
