SER_SP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Adriatic War was sparked by the Italians supporting the anti-Yugoslav elements in Montenegro, and tore apart the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, splitting among three states.

The loss of all Great War gains caused mass unrest in Serbia, and in order to prevent it from escalating further, the parliament was suspended and all political organizations were banned. However, 10 years have passed since then, and King Alexander’s power is caving under pressure and various concessions to underground organizer and activists. He is massively unpopular, and probably won’t hold up for long."

On May Day, Thousands of workers poured out into the streets of Belgrade, bearing illegal symbols such as red flags and hammers and sickles, and shouting communist slogans, demanding labor rights and even removal of Alexander II from power. The gendarmerie attempted to control it, eventually with lethal force, but things escalated even further as some of the protesters begun to shoot back. Unrest is spreading in other places in the country, and it looks like these may be the last days of the kingdom."
