PRM_persue_traitors:0 "Pursue Syndicalist Traitors"

PRM_expand_local_power_desc:0 "The counts, dukes, and marquesses of the land have, for too long, been just titular title holders, indifferent to the lands they've ruled.

PRM_local_rulership:0 "Local Autonomy"
PRM_local_rulership_desc:0 "Who else would best know how to deal with problems within a community than community leaders themselves?

PRM_codified_decentralization:0 "Codified Decentralisation"
PRM_codified_decentralization_desc:0 "The increase of power and autonomy for local leaders can also pave the way for future conflict between the local leadership and the central government.

PRM_abolish_parlament_desc:0 "In his wisdom, and with much regret, the sovereign must inform the people of Portugal that the skeleton of the Parliament, with its outdated ideas, is to be banished; a House of Lords, the best and brighest of Portugal, will now exert legislative power instead of the opportunists within Parliament."

PRM_economical_strongstance_desc:0 "We cannot allow the economic views and/or the concepts created by politicians to get in the way of the new Portugal. Even if it means reminding some of them who truly holds power within a Kingdom."

PRM_navy:0 "Régia Marinha"
PRM_navy_desc:0 "Our navy, while undergoing expansion during the Weltkrieg, is still not capable of properly defending our overseas provinces, nor our coastline! Relying on allied navies may not be an option available to us, so we must act now."
PRM_raise_regulos:0 "Raise Regúlo Regiments"
PRM_raise_regulos_desc:0 "Our vassal Kings, loyal and thankful subjects, must realise that tensions between us and the Huns are quickly rising. If they do not arm their subjects, they risk falling under the yoke of the Hunnic Butcher."

PRM_punish_traitors_desc:0 "Despite our best effort, rebels within Mozambique have continued to exist and resent our glorious kingdom.

PRM_imperio:0 "Ultramarine Effort"

PRM_enforce_colonial_act_desc:0 "While groundbreaking legislation has been approved in the past decades, the laws have not been enforced within our overseas provinces. We mustn't allow complacency to take hold; laws are made to be enforced and we shall enforce them!"
PRM_protect_mozambique:0 "Protect Mozambique"
PRM_protect_mozambique_desc:0 "According to our top military experts, the best approach in defending Mozambique would be the forfeiture of its northern and unruly region, thereby establishing a safe perimeter within the Zambeze. Following this plan will help significantly improve our capacity to fend off aggression in Mozambique."
PRM_protect_angola:0 "Protect Angola"
PRM_protect_angola_desc:0 "The two biggest cities in Angola, Nova Lisboa and Luanda, should be our top priority in terms of defence. We must ensure that our flag flies atop these cities for eternity!"
PRM_modernized_administators:0 "Hire Modern Administrators"
PRM_modernized_administators_desc:0 "Most of their colonial administrators, when granted their posts, sought an easy, laid back assignment within the tropics. It is time to replace them with new, energetic youth who will be engaged and ready to carry out our colonial mission."

PRM_casa_dos_estudantes_do_imperio_desc:0 "A formal house for students from our overseas provinces, the Home of the Students of the Empire is now be a beacon of pride and efficiency. This investment in academia will surely have more... practical uses for our government, as well."

PRM_sao_tome_desc:0 "Plantations in São Tomé are underpopulated while Cape Verde is overpopulated.

PRM_macau:0 "Protect and Develop Macau"
PRM_macau_desc:0 "Macau is a crown jewel of the empire, envied by the Chinese because of its prosperity. However, it is also very far away from the Portugal. This means that, in the case of an attack, the province would have to hold on without support. To make matters worse, the government’s hold on the province is also very poor. In light of this information, we must prepare initiatives to defend and develop Macau."
PRM_goa:0 "Defend the State of India"
PRM_goa_desc:0 "The State of India, once safely protected due to the British control of the Indian subcontinent, is continually at risk of being attacked by either the Syndicalists in the east or the treacherous Princes in the south.

PRM_grande_armada:0 "A Grande Armada"
PRM_grande_armada_desc:0 "Possessing a carrier fleet is more than having a few airplanes at sea; it is the possibility of power projection, both aerially and navally, and controlling the naval battlefield.

PRM_the_fleet_of_the_empire:0 "The Imperial Navy"
PRM_the_fleet_of_the_empire_desc:0 "Establishing empire wide naval production standards and procedures will be a costly effort, but will most certainly pay off in the long run; The faster and more efficient our shipyards are, the sooner we can wrest absolute control of the seas!"

PRM_backfoot_armada:0 "A Backfoot Armada"
PRM_backfoot_armada_desc:0 "Since we cannot hope to match the existing naval powers of the world and defeat them in conventional battles, we must adapt our navy to help support our allies as they take on the bigger, more expensive ships."
PRM_escort_effort:0 "Escort Effort"
PRM_escort_effort_desc:0 "Escorting supply convoys to our overseas provinces safely is a task requiring the utmost importance. We cannot allow the lifeblood of the empire to face external threats!"
PRM_raiders:0 "Modern Corsairs"

PRM_raiding_squads:0 "Planning for Asymmetrical Warfare"
PRM_raiding_squads_desc:0 "Planning a war against the world’s biggest navy is not, by any means, an easily accomplished task. It will require much effort and calculation with our allies, admirals, and seamen. However, the tactics we use to deal with the War at Sea will certainly be crucial."
PRM_submarines:0 "Hunting Teams"
PRM_submarines_desc:0 "One of the most crucial aspects of a raiding navy is operational autonomy and co-operation between the ships within the fleet. By organising our forces to act as ‘Hunting Teams’, which will be used to harass and attack enemy light ships and supply ships, we can ensure that our raiding navy will be extremely efficient."
PRM_ubarcos:0 "Imperial Submarine Force"

As Aetius once did, we shattered the illusion of Hunnic invincibility, and people around the world will honour with us the heroes in our struggle! Não Passarão! Angola é Portugal!"
PRM_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward our Loyal Subjects"
PRM_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "We often see the true mettle of a vassal when his liege is on the edge of a knife. Risking everything, many who could have been complacent fought for us. Some out of genuine loyalty, others for the thrill of battle, and some simply to prevent the alternative: being ruled by the Butcher of Mahenge, who sees all non-Germans as little more than beasts of Burden. All will have their loyalty rewarded!"
PRM_redouble_investments:0 "Redouble our Colonial Investments"

PRM_zambia_e_nossa:0 "Snatch Zambia!"
PRM_zambia_e_nossa_desc:0 "Because of their thirst for earthly riches, the Germans have completely failed in their duty. They’ve alienated their subjects within Africa and the continent itself is in a state of disarray the likes of which has never been seen before. We can capitalise upon this opportunity and expand our empire, which will see the unification of our African provinces!"
PRM_pinko:0 "The Pink Map"
PRM_pinko_desc:0 "Because of the anarchy that has taken ahold of Africa, we may finally achieve the old goal of the Pink Map and exert control over vast swathes of land between Angola and Mozambique.

PRM_dockyard_desc:0 "For far too long the Royal Navy has consisted of little more than mere escort vessels for convoys.

prm.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Portugal"
prm.1.d:0 "After a disastrous military showing in the Great War and the crushing defeats in Mozambique without any significant territorial gain, the Portuguese Republic was brought to the brink of collapse by 1919. The government had experienced the same humiliation and ineffectiveness that ended the Kingdom of Portugal less than a decade earlier, and it became clear that much of the country had begun to reconsider the Republican Revolution when pro-Monarchist militias seized the north in the first revolt. The army reluctantly put down the rebellion, however many of its leaders were let free because of their status as war heroes and icons. \n\nHowever, with much of Europe succumbing to socialist revolutions in the 1920s, tensions between the far right and far left in Portugal skyrocketed, and the moderate Republican government found itself becoming increasingly alienated among the populace. These tensions continued to boil as the government slowly collapsed and the economy with it. The military attempted to execute a coup in 1926, however the strong left wing supported the Republican government and the coup was only narrowly defeated. The government pursued the conspirators, whom many fled across the border to Spain or to the north where the stronger right wing base sheltered them. Despite the coup being defeated, the Republic continued its downward spiral as moderate leaders found their attempts to keep the left wing coalition which had saved the republic from consolidating power. \n\nThese attempts failed, however, when the Revolução Rosa of October 1931 overthrew the government relatively peacefully in Lisbon, the more rural right wing leaning north was quick to oppose this move, and the city of Porto erupted in a full out rebellion, with barricades being erected on every street manned by man and women alike. However, the government in the south had found other issues, such as an embargo by both Spain and the United Kingdom. This delayed the response to the rebellion in the north, and the rebels declared the republic defunct and illegitimate, proclaiming the Kingdom of Portugal in its place once again. However, the movement was quick to spread across the countryside, and enjoyed the support of its neighbors. British support ensured that the overseas territories of Portugal came under the control of the new monarchy, and Manuel II officially endorsed the revolt in November, returning to Portugal through Spain in November. \n\nIt is now the start of 1932, and the few months of small skirmishes have begun to show cracks as the conflict evolves further into a Civil War. No matter which side emerges victorious, no one can doubt that this period will have a significant impact on the future of Portugal."

prm.2.t:0 "Large Skirmish at Coimbra"
prm.2.d:0 "After months of minor skirmishes that have only ended in stalemate, our forces, without orders, have converged on the city of Coimbra near the de facto 'front line'. Although this wouldn't usually be of much concern, thousands of Republican forces have been reported to be moving to reinforce the city, and skirmishes have been reported across the whole front line. Our generals have recommended to begin a wide offensive before the Republicans can organize, and Manuel II seems to agree."
