### Focuses ###

LIV_Duchy_Restoration:0 "Restoration of the Baltic Duchy"
LIV_Duchy_Restoration_desc:0 ""

LIV_Duchy_Kaiser:0 "Return of the Kaiser"
LIV_Duchy_Kaiser_desc:0 "Almost two decades have passed since we achieved our status as a German protectorate. These decades have turned our nation into a German-dominated state, and we must respect their wishes. The Kaiser calls for Germanisation, and we shall follow suit. Drang Nach Osten!"

LIV_Emancipation:0 "Emancipation"
LIV_Emancipation_desc:0 "Almost two decades have passed since we achieved our status as a German protectorate. The Germans dominate our industry, our politics, and our military. We may be Germans too, but the Vaterland is growing weak, it is perhaps our chance to break those ties."

LIV_Duchy_Kaiser_Ind:0 "Maintain our Independence"
LIV_Duchy_Kaiser_Ind_desc:0 "Kurland, or Kursas as the locals call it, shall be the first step towards the full Germanisation of our Duchy. It will be easy to turn this region into a German-dominated one, despite some native resistance."

LIV_Ger_Livland1:0 "Colonise Livland"
LIV_Ger_Livland1_desc:0 "Livland, referred to by the locals as Latgale, is the heart of our very Duchy, and yet the countryside of this region is still mostly Latvian. Hopefully, not for long."

LIV_Ger_Estland1:0 "Colonise Estland"
LIV_Ger_Estland1_desc:0 "Estland, or Estonia according to the locals, is the final step towards the full Germanisation of our Duchy. We already have experience in strategic immigrant settling and fighting local language usage, so this will be an easy task."

LIV_Ger_Kurland2:0 "Deutsch-Kurland"
LIV_Ger_Kurland2_desc:0 "The Germanisation project has yielded exactly the results we needed. The percentage of Germans in Kurland is growing every day, and despite native resistance, the ideal of Drang nach Osten grows stronger every day."

LIV_Ger_Livland2:0 "Deutsch-Livland"
LIV_Ger_Livland2_desc:0 "The Germanisation project has yielded exactly the results we needed. The percentage of Germans in Livland is growing every day, and despite native resistance, the ideal of Drang nach Osten grows stronger every day."

LIV_Ger_Estland2:0 "Deutsch-Estland"
LIV_Ger_Estland2_desc:0 "The Germanisation project has yielded exactly the results we needed. The percentage of Germans in Estland is growing every day, and despite native resistance, the ideal of Drang nach Osten grows stronger every day."

LIV_Ger_Baltic:0 "Deutsch-Baltika"
LIV_Ger_Baltic_desc:0 "The process of Germanisation has been successful. The Baltic Germans are now the dominant nation in population as well as in politics. We are finally eligible to apply to become an Imperial State, if that's is what we want, of course."

LIV_Ger_Integration:0 "Integration"
LIV_Ger_Integration_desc:0 "The Vaterland calls! We are Germans, and our Duchy shall become the 29th Imperial State! A glorious future awaits us under the full protection and oversight of the German Vaterland."

LIV_Ger_Puppet:0 "Status Quo"
LIV_Ger_Puppet_desc:0 "Reuniting with the Vaterland is important, but not the top priority. While we may be Germans, we are Baltic Germans, and we must receive special treatment. Reunification can wait, we must deal with local matters first."

LIV_Ger_Indep:0 "Independence"
LIV_Ger_Indep_desc:0 "The valley between Vaterland Germans and Baltic Germans will never, and we do mean never, be treaded over by the Empire. We, the Germans of Livland, Kurland and Estland, must cease all dealings with the mainland, and declare independence!"

LIV_Ger_Autonomy1:0 "Autonomy under the Germans"
LIV_Ger_Autonomy1_desc:0 "It is time for us to reform. The conservatives within the Baltic Landtag want to turn the nation into a parliamentary monarchy and abandon the nigh-absolutist practices of Adolf Friedrich I. Should we listen?"

LIV_Ger_Autonomy2:0 "Confronting the Kaiser"
LIV_Ger_Autonomy2_desc:0 "The Vaterland is disappointed. To them, a strong parliamentary Baltic Duchy means a more autonomous and resistant Baltic Duchy. Our relations with the Kaiser have been damaged. It is time we finally confront the Kaiser about our increased political autonomy instead of leaving the resolution of this conflict to chance."

LIV_Ger_Autonomy3:0 "Centralise the Government"
LIV_Ger_Autonomy3_desc:0 "The apparatus of the Ducal government is weak, rife with corruption and heavily decentralised, we must enact substantial governmental reforms before advancing forward, so that our country may prosper even without the help of the Kaiser."

LIV_Ger_Autonomy4:0 "Break the Chains"
LIV_Ger_Autonomy4_desc:0 "The rift between Baltic Germans and the government of the Kaiserreich is growing deeper every day, and we can use this as an opportunity to finally increase our autonomy and maybe even finally obtain free elections for all."

LIV_Ger_Autonomy5:0 "Promises of Democracy"
LIV_Ger_Autonomy5_desc:0 "We have promised the people of the Duchy that the first free elections to the Baltic Landtag are coming soon. The people rejoice that they may finally choose the fate of their country, at least for once."

LIV_Fed1:0 "The Multicultural State"
LIV_Fed1_desc:0 "The Germans are not the only people living in the United Baltic Duchy. Latvians, Estonians and Russians all make up significant portions of the population, too, and they demand to be recognised and represented in the government. We shall consider it."

LIV_Fed2:0 "The Baltic Federation"
LIV_Fed2_desc:0 "Andrevs Niedra, a puppet head of government we placed to pacify the locals, has proposed a seemingly radical idea, reforming the Duchy into a democratic Baltic Federation, where not only Germans, but also the local Balts can have a say in how they are ruled. It seems like a good idea after all."

LIV_Fed3:0 "First Landtag Elections"
LIV_Fed3_desc:0 "We have promised free elections as part of the future of our newly founded Federation, and it is high time for us to fulfil this promise. The Baltic peoples will now finally decide the fate of their country."

LIV_Fed4:0 "Baltic Trade"
LIV_Fed4_desc:0 "The new democratic Baltic state is rife for trade dominance in the Baltic Sea. Our new political course will be beneficial to our trading centres and our port cities, so we must develop them to use this advantage to its fullest."

LIV_Fed5:0 "Independence Referendum"
LIV_Fed5_desc:0 "We had never truly planned to break our ties with Germany, but more and more people are demanding the Baltic Federation to become an independent state. We have found a compromise, an independence referendum. Of course, even with a majority in favour of independence, there's no telling whether the Kaiser will approve."

LIV_Education:0 "Education Reform"
LIV_Education_desc:0 "The large Latvian and Estonian contingent in the Baltic Landtag is demanding a comprehensive education reform. Latvian and Estonian need to be accepted as secondary languages and the discrimination against the local Balts in schools must stop. This seems acceptable."

LIV_Press:0 "A Free Press"
LIV_Press_desc:0 "Ever since the foundation of our nation, there have been severe limitations to the freedom of our press. This has come to light in recent events, and our people want profound reforms. The conservatives oppose these changes, while the liberal faction in the Landtag are in favour of them."

LIV_Lib1:0 "A Liberal Duchy"
LIV_Lib1_desc:0 "The Liberal faction has secured a stable majority coalition in the Landtag, and this faction demands for the Duchy to be liberalised and rid of the worst parts of Imperial and Ducal influence imposed to us by the Vaterland."

LIV_Lib2:0 "Ducal Elections"
LIV_Lib2_desc:0 "The liberals demand a free election to be held for the Landtag! It may seem like a radical proposal, but times are clearly changing. The near absolutism we used to live in may no longer endure as democracy once again shines on the horizon of Europe."

LIV_Lib3:0 "Cultural Equality"
LIV_Lib3_desc:0 "Germans, Balts, Estonians and Russians, we are all the same. We must follow the principles of equality and extend the rights of cultural autonomy to all nations within the state. Even if the Baltic Germans are to remain dominant, of course."

LIV_Lib4:0 "Economic Liberalisation"
LIV_Lib4_desc:0 "The liberal faction believes that the state must interfere as little as possible in the affairs of the economy, and this outlook has attracted lots of private investment into our nation. The economy may grow freely, for we will reap the rewards quickly."

LIV_ERP:0 "Economic Recovery Plan"
LIV_ERP_desc:0 "The crisis known as the Black Monday has caused many troubles for our economy. More than fifty thousand people had lost their jobs at the end of first day. We have got to do something, and our ministers are already preparing a plan to save our economy."

LIV_ERP_Gov1:0 "Government Intervention"
LIV_ERP_Gov1_desc:0 "We cannot allow this stagnation to continue. The government should assume control of all the major facilities. It is a harsh policy that will surely stifle our private sector, but it will steer our economy out of trouble."

LIV_ERP_Gov2:0 "Build Up Our Roads"
LIV_ERP_Gov2_desc:0 "Many unemployed citizens are trying to find any kind of job. We can help them by sending them on construction works. They will build up our roads and we will pay them. This way we can kill two birds with one stone."

LIV_ERP_Gov3:0 "Social Investments"
LIV_ERP_Gov3_desc:0 "To solve our economic problems, we need a stable society. Some benefits for the poorest in our Duchy should be established. Everybody deserves at least basic economic security, and this will help maintain order in our population."

LIV_ERP_Gov4:0 "Baltic Arsenals"
LIV_ERP_Gov4_desc:0 "Our country has always had a problem with the military sector. Now, with many free hands available, we can send them to military factories to produce guns, tanks and aircrafts. This again should solve many problems at once."

LIV_Eco_Naval1:0 "Baltic Dockyards"
LIV_Eco_Naval1_desc:0 "We are a coastal country, almost half of our lands border the Baltic sea. Now, with many free hands available, we can send them to dockyards to build up our fleet. A large and prosperous Baltic navy will raise."

LIV_Eco_Naval2:0 "Baltic Trade League"
LIV_Eco_Naval2_desc:0 "There are many countries around the Baltic sea. We desperately need new trade partners, and they can indeed be very good trade partners to us. We should we establish new trade routes in the Baltic sea."

LIV_Eco_Naval3:0 "Naval Innovations"
LIV_Eco_Naval3_desc:0 "Our recent naval activity has shown that our navy should be reorganised. We can learn many new things from major countries and use this knowledge in our projects for both the merchant navy and our growing Baltic fleet."

LIV_ERP_FM1:0 "Rely on Local Businesses"
LIV_ERP_FM1_desc:0 "We cannot allow this stagnation to continue. If we enact strong laissez-faire policies, it will open many opportunities for local businesses and the private sector. Our capitalists and the free market will save the economy."

LIV_ERP_FM2:0 "Invest in Our Scientists"
LIV_ERP_FM2_desc:0 "Every prosperous country has to rely on its scientists. We have to invest in our future now for a brighter tomorrow. Knowledge will always be a powerful weapon, and a source of economic and social prosperity."

LIV_ERP_FM3:0 "Social Investments"
LIV_ERP_FM3_desc:0 "To solve our economic problems, we need a stable society. Some benefits for the poorest in our Duchy should be established. Everybody deserves at least basic economic security, and this will help maintain order in our population."

LIV_ERP_FM4:0 "Political Establishment"
LIV_ERP_FM4_desc:0 "Our capitalists are becoming more and more powerful, even starting to influence our politics. If we let them capitalise on that political clout, they will become important and trustworthy allies."

LIV_ERP_End:0 "Recovery from Crisis"
LIV_ERP_End_desc:0 "Hurrah! Under our wise rule, the Duchy has survived this crisis. It seems, at least for us, that the worst of the Black Monday is over. Prosperity is once more the law of the land, and shall stay so!"

LIV_Army_Start:0 "Baltic Army"
LIV_Army_Start_desc:0 "Officially, we do have an army. But it actually consists of nothing more than a bunch of young boys with rifles. Military doctrine is the first thing we need to modernise. Decades have passed since the end of the Weltkrieg and our current doctrine is now clearly outdated."

LIV_Army_Cons:0 "Conscription Question"
LIV_Army_Cons_desc:0 "Native Balts, the majority of our country's population, are not currently allowed to serve in the army. Should we finally lift some of these restrictions, or should we keep the army the sole affair of the Germans?"

LIV_Army_Cons2:0 "Balts for Baltic Army"
LIV_Army_Cons2_desc:0 "Native Balts, the majority of our country's population, are not currently allowed to serve in the army. Enough is enough, we will immediately open up the army's rank, but this may take some time to have an effect."

LIV_Army_Inf1:0 "Modern Equipment"
LIV_Army_Inf1_desc:0 "Most of our troops use clearly obsolete equipment. The Weltkrieg is long over, we need to change our equipment so that our brave soldiers fight with the best money and technology has to offer. We are a militia no more!"

LIV_Army_Inf2:0 "Improve our Training System"
LIV_Army_Inf2_desc:0 "We should reorganise and modernise our training system. New drilling methods will shorten boot camp times and stronger emphasis on actual combat training will increase the combat readiness of our troops."

LIV_Army_Doc1:0 "War Games"
LIV_Army_Doc1_desc:0 "Our military staff still push for old tactics and doctrines. We desperately need to change their minds. If we start organising regular war games, we will slowly but surely force them to adapt to the realities of modern warfare."

LIV_Army_Doc2:0 "Modern Doctrine Effort"
LIV_Army_Doc2_desc:0 "Now our generals are prepared for the realities of today's warfare. But even better, they now seem to have finally adopted a more innovative and forward-thinking mindset. Let us warmly welcome any suggestions from them, to seek new tactics to implement."

LIV_Army_Mot:0 "Mobile Army"
LIV_Army_Mot_desc:0 "We can significantly improve the speed of our troops by simply adopting motorised vehicles as an integral part of our division design. These new troops will be attached to their trucks as cavalry were with their horses, now we just need to figure out the tactical and organisational details."

LIV_Army_Arm:0 "Armour Blueprints"
LIV_Army_Arm_desc:0 "It seems that tanks become more and more powerful and practical every day, not that the Weltkrieg had not already showcased their potential by shattering the tactics of trench warfare. Every modern army will come to rely on them, and so should we. We will build our own."

LIV_Army_Def1:0 "Modern Artillery"
LIV_Army_Def1_desc:0 "The artillery cannon will always be useful. But as any kind of equipment, we should seek to modernise it. New artillery will be even more powerful than we can yet imagine, with bigger calibers, bigger guns, and bigger payloads."

LIV_Army_Fort1:0 "Ostwall Fortifications"
LIV_Army_Fort1_desc:0 "The Ostwall is a concept for a line of fortifications along the Russian border. It will take a long time to complete but the results will be impressive, and its tactical advantages obvious."

LIV_Army_Fort2:0 "Improve Ostwall"
LIV_Army_Fort2_desc:0 "The construction of the Ostwall is now under way. Many workers and soldiers work on it every day. Sooner or later, the work will be complete, but we should be ready to invest additional effort to speed up the project should trouble arise."

LIV_Army_FortGer:0 "Forced Labour"
LIV_Army_FortGer_desc:0 "Our workers are simply too slow. Why are these bloody Balts resting while our German boys are ahead of their schedule? We must force them to work, so the Ostwall will be complete even faster than we have predicted."

LIV_Army_FortBal:0 "Invest in Construction Network"
LIV_Army_FortBal_desc:0 "Our workers are simply too slow. If we create even more job vacancies, the work might be done even faster than we have predicted. In all cases, we can only get the work done faster by investing into it selflessly."

LIV_Army_FortComplete:0 "New Ostwall Line"
LIV_Army_FortComplete_desc:0 "The new Ostwall Line is finally complete. Now, our borders are safe and strong. We do not need to fear the Russians anymore, let them come to us. See if they can even set a foot into Livland or Estland."

LIV_Army_Mil_Navy1:0 "Baltic Fleet"
LIV_Army_Mil_Navy1_desc:0 "Since Peter the Great, many naval battles have been fought in the Baltic Sea. We are proud of the prestige and legacy of our navy and we will focus on improving our ships even more."

LIV_Army_Mil_Navy_Old:0 "Naval Traditions"
LIV_Army_Mil_Navy_Old_desc:0 "The power of our navy lies in its traditions. Instead of investing endless funds into new hulls, we can always improve and refit our old ships. A battleship shall always be a battleship."

LIV_Army_Mil_Navy_New:0 "New Naval Technologies"
LIV_Army_Mil_Navy_New_desc:0 "Traditions are good, but we can't afford to forget about new technologies. Instead of praising the old ways, we should invest our funds into some brand new naval technologies like submarines."

LIV_Army_Mil_Navy_Doc:0 "Our Brave Officers"
LIV_Army_Mil_Navy_Doc_desc:0 "Our naval officers are some of the best officers of Europe. We should encourage them and create more favourable working conditions for them to encourage them to stay and improve our navy."

LIV_Army_Mil_Navy_Transport:0 "Elite Baltic Marines"
LIV_Army_Mil_Navy_Transport_desc:0 "With our long coastline, we will always be threatened by naval invasions. We should teach some of our troops to fight in such conditions and even perform autonomous naval landings."

LIV_Air1:0 "Expand Air Bases"
LIV_Air1_desc:0 "Aviation never was our forte, ever since the introduction of airplanes during the Weltkrieg we have been struggling to catch up. We should build some airfields now and start training for the future of warfare."

LIV_Air_CAS:0 "CAS Effort"
LIV_Air_CAS_desc:0 "A modern army needs support from vehicles not only on the ground, but also in the air. Certainly a concept that will be easy for our officers to understand."

LIV_Air_Fighter:0 "Fighter Effort"
LIV_Air_Fighter_desc:0 "We have not seen the last of the dogfights in the Weltkrieg. Keeping ahead in the development of fighter planes will give us an edge future air battles."

LIV_Air_Nav_Bomber:0 "Naval Bomber Effort"
LIV_Air_Nav_Bomber_desc:0 "Ships have proven exceptionally vulnerable to aircrafts. We should keep improving on their technology to ensure we stay ahead of any countermeasures and get the edge in large naval confrontations."

LIV_Air_Doc:0 "Air Innovations"
LIV_Air_Doc_desc:0 "Modern wars cannot be won without dominating the skies. We must do everything in our power to develop the air force until we are able to protect our skies as well as we protect our seas and lands!"

LIV_Air_End:0 "Baltic Aviation"
LIV_Air_End_desc:0 "Now, that is what we call aviation. Our recent efforts have shown very impressive results. Maybe we are not the kings of the sky, but our pilots can fight well enough to give any enemy plane a run for his money."

LIV_Education_Ger:0 "Education Reform"
LIV_Education_Ger_desc:0 "With more power to the Duke, the time has come for us to rethink our system of education. We have made some great strides in educating the younger masses, but our universities are already full. If we invest some money and open more universities, more people will get a higher education."

### Ideas ###

LIV_military_with_state:0 "Military with a State"
LIV_military_with_state_desc:0 "Livonia is often remarked as a 'Military with a State' for its mass militarization. This is, however, necessary for their survival. The Baltic natives are often considered unreliable, and a small defense force would mean certain death in the face of a strong Soviet state to the east. Each and every German in these lands are prepared for war."

LIV_baltic_conscription_crisis:0 "Native Conscription Crisis"
LIV_baltic_conscription_crisis_desc:0 "Although Livonia is well known for its mass conscription of Germans, the Baltic natives themselves make up only a very small portion of the military and often are organized into independent militias whom lack proper equipment. Their lack of representation in the government also fuels many natives to avoid entering the army, and Estonians in particular are more compelled to serve in the Estonian puppet regime in the north."

LIV_multi_ling:0 "Political Instability"
LIV_multi_ling_desc:0 "Our country is an union of multiple cultures. The Native Balts, the Germanised Balts and the Russian minorities all vie for political influence, causing regular conflict and difficulty to set a common policy. This is only made much worse by the German dominance caused by the Kaiser's policies of Germanisation, crushing minority rights and forcing cultural conversion of the 'Native Balts'."

LIV_start_crisis:0 "Conscription Crisis"
LIV_start_crisis_desc:0 "Only people of German descent or having sufficiently Germanised are allowed into the armed forces. Naturally, as the majority of the people in our country are Native Balts and resistance to Germanisation is still high, this poses massive conscription issues. However, due to significant unrest and the ever present risk of a revolt, this is currently seen as a necessary evil."

LIV_multi_ling_aut:0 "Minor Autonomy"
LIV_multi_ling_aut_desc:0 "Following some diplomatic manoeuvring, we have successfully put an end to the Kaiser's plans of Germanisation. Our country is still shattered, but our people are grateful that we saved our minorities from cultural indoctrination. These wounds will take time to heal, but at least they will be able to heal."

LIV_german_majority:0 "German Majority"
LIV_german_majority_desc:0 "Following a recent push for Germanisation, we have finally achieved a significant milestone. The majority of our country is now considered German, and as such our position in the country as the majority culture is secure. This not only allows us to finally end the recent instability, but also to enforce the will of the German people on those Native and Russian rebels."

LIV_schools:0 "New Education System"
LIV_schools_desc:0 "Reforming our education system is easier said than done. But with some improvements made to our curriculum, we expect that our country's literacy will increase, and higher education will eventually become a reality to a larger part of our youth, with benefits all across our society."

LIV_factory:0 "Economic Boom"
LIV_factory_desc:0 "The liberalisation of our economy has had the effect that we hoped, with construction and production once again roaring through our lands. This allows us to contract our newly-recovered economy to peform major infrastructure works, faster and cheaper."

LIV_militia:0 "Baltic Militia"
LIV_militia_desc:0 "With the mighty German army promising to defend our country against aggression, the organisation of our country's military from its very inception has been relaxed, to say the least. We need to remedy to this, wherever we are to still benefit of Germany's protection, or especially if we are to lose it."

LIV_Black_Monday:0 "Aftermath of Black Monday"
LIV_Black_Monday_desc:0 "As a country deeply within the Kaiserreich's sphere of influence, the impact of the Black Monday has been brutal to our economy. However, we cannot wait for Germany to fix her own economy, there is work to be done at home. The unrest cannot be ignored, and might be costly if left to boil."

LIV_gov_goods:0 "Social Investments"
LIV_gov_goods_desc:0 "Welfare is turning out to be one of the most important policies we have to help our people cope with this crisis. This also creates a situation where the poorest of our society can now prosper in our country, allowing us to slowly scale down the emergency programs."

LIV_heavy_industry:0 "Baltic Workers"
LIV_heavy_industry_desc:0 "With the effort of some of our people redirected to military factories, we have finally managed to improve our production of military hardware. This will create a skilled and dedicated military workforce on the long run. If some are to be believed, one that will come handy sooner than desired."

LIV_scientists:0 "New Scientists"
LIV_scientists_desc:0 "Scientific discoveries don't just magically appear out of thin air. By investing heavily in scientific pursuits even in times of trouble, we encourage our scientists and research teams to give the best for our country, and merely give them the means to do so."

LIV_pol:0 "Political Establishment"
LIV_pol_desc:0 "There might be those who decry the new influence of some capitalists on our economy, but this direct connection of the political and economic worlds allow us to strengthen our decision-making and help influence our nation's economy, for the better."

LIV_drill:0 "Modern Training System"
LIV_drill_desc:0 "Training a soldier is more complex than teaching him how to shoot his rifle and throw his hand grenades. By perfecting our drill system, we make boot camp faster, more efficient at turning the average citizen into a competent soldier, and thus capable of more rapidly mobilising new divisions, even those of a new concept to us."

LIV_fort:0 "Ostwall Fortifications Network"
LIV_fort_desc:0 "The Ostwall is more than a few isolated bunkers. A complex and carefully designed network of fortication works, integrating natural chokepoints and artificial constructions alike, it will prove a challenge to any invading forces. Likewise, it will also help us design future expansions, and even brand new fortification lines."

LIV_balts_rebellion:0 "Balts Uprising"
LIV_balts_rebellion_desc:0 "Our policy of colonisation caused an uprising of Native Balts. We surely can handle this by ourselves, not involving Vaterland into our political situation (It's recommended not to call Germany into war)."

### Flags ###
