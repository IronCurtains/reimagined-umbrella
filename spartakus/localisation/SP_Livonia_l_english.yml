liv.1.t:0 "Restoring the Baltic Duchy"
liv.1.d:0 "We have torn down the military regime of Ruediger von der Goltz and have restored the Ducal government."
liv.1.a:0 "Nice!"

liv.2.t:0 "Organizing the Baltic Duchy"
liv.2.d:0 "How shall we organize the Baltic Duchy?"
liv.2.a:0 "We are a Liberal Duchy."

liv.3.t:0 "Duchy Dissolved!"
liv.3.d:0 "The United Baltic Duchy has been dissolved."
liv.3.a:0 "Oh no!"

livfoc.1.t:0 "The Landeswehr Reforms"
livfoc.1.d:0 "The Baltische Landeswehr is the dominating force of Livonia in many ways. Not only does it function as the defense force, but it also runs the government as a military dictatorship all but in name. Though the Latvian, Andreivs Niedra, is officially the head of government, everyone knows he lacks any power being surrounded by a cabinet made entirely of military veterans and aristocrats. This has, however, resulted in some issues with our relatively reactionary military bereaucracy. \n\nThe right wing Freikorps militias, which are officially unconnected with the Baltische Landeswehr, have been allowed to run rampant through the countryside. These Freikorps have been responsible for many terrible crimes. On top of this, lack of funding and care for Latvian and Estonian recruitment has resulted in a massive conscription crisis that has seriously hurt our military capabilities. \n\nWe can only choose to reform one of these issues at a time. Which will it be?"
livfoc.1.a:0 "We shall focus on resolving the Conscription Crisis."
livfoc.1.b:0 "We shall focus on deciding the fate of the Freikorps."

livfoc.2.t:0 "The Question of Conscription Reform"
livfoc.2.d:0 "Ever since our mostly German army crushed the Estonian and Latvian resistance and established the Livonian state, the Baltic natives have actively resisted our attempts to recruit them and very little has been done by our military bureaucracy to provide incentives for them to join our ranks. The few Baltic regiments have been provided with little supplies and often are deprived of proper weaponry or weaponry at all. All of this combined has resulted in an extremely troublesome conscription crisis, and it is clear that in order to prepare for the years to come the fate of the Balts in our army has to be decided."
livfoc.2.a:0 "Enough! Establish a German-only army."
livfoc.2.b:0 "Reform! Establish a Mixed army of Germans and Balts."
livfoc.2.c:0 "End this! Establish a Balt-only army."

### Ideas ###

LIV_military_with_state:0 "Military with a State"
LIV_military_with_state_desc:0 "Livonia is often remarked as a 'Military with a State' for its mass militarization. This is, however, necessary for their survival. The Baltic natives are often considered unreliable, and a small defense force would mean certain death in the face of a strong Soviet state to the east. Each and every German in these lands are prepared for war."

LIV_freikorps:0 "The Freikorps"
LIV_freikorps_desc:0 "A significant amount of our army holds far right wing sympathies as a part of the so called Freikorps. These Freikorps, of whom many fled to our lands after the defeat in Germany, were crucial in securing the independence of Livonia. However, they have also caused various heartaches for the government by tarnishing our reputation among the Baltic natives. Burgulary, rape and murder are rampant among these Freikorps divisions. We can do something about this, but at the cost of losing some of our fighting force."

LIV_baltic_conscription_crisis:0 "Native Conscription Crisis"
LIV_baltic_conscription_crisis_desc:0 "Although Livonia is well known for its mass conscription of Germans, the Baltic natives themselves make up only a very small portion of the military and often are organized into independent militias whom lack proper equipment. Their lack of representation in the government also fuels many natives to avoid entering the army, and Estonians in particular are more compelled to serve in the Estonian puppet regime in the north."

LIV_german_army:0 "A German Army"
LIV_german_army_desc:0 "Previously our military was mostly organized into seperate units with Latvians and Estonians generally being placed in undermanned, undersupplied divisions. Instead of bringing these troops to the same standard as our German units, we have eliminated Baltic recruitment eentirely at the cost of manpower."

LIV_german_army_prussian:0 "A Prussian Army"
LIV_german_army_prussian_desc:0 "Previously our military was mostly organized into seperate units with Latvians and Estonians generally being placed in undermanned, undersupplied divisions.

LIV_mixed_army:0 "A Mixed Army"
LIV_mixed_army_desc:0 "Previously our military was mostly organized into seperate units with Latvians and Estonians generally being placed in undermanned, undersupplied divisions. While it is true we may never truly convince every native to join, a military no longer divided by nationality will surely convince enough to bolster our ranks significantly."

LIV_baltic_army:0 "A Baltic Army"
LIV_baltic_army_desc:0 "Previously our military was mostly organized into seperate units with Latvians and Estonians generally being placed in undermanned, undersupplied divisions. While it is true we may never truly convince every native to join, the elimination of German favoritism through ending future German recruitment will help bolster our ranks to numbers never seen before."
