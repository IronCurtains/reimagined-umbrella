### Ideas ###

BMR_military_with_state:0 "Military with a State"
BMR_military_with_state_desc:0 "Livonia is often remarked as a 'Military with a State' for its mass militarization. This is, however, necessary for their survival. The Baltic natives are often considered unreliable, and a small defense force would mean certain death in the face of a strong Soviet state to the east. Each and every German in these lands are prepared for war."
