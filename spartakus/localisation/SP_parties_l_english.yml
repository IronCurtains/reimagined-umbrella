democratic_socialist_subtype_desc:0 " Democratic Socialism is considered the most moderate socialist ideology. Not to be confused with Social Democracy, it advocates for a fully socialist economy but with fully democratic functions. Generally, Democratic Socialists are vehemently opposed to the Marxist-Leninist model of communism, and also criticize the capitalistic nature of Social Democrats."
marxist_leninist_subtype_desc:0 "Marxist Leninism is a Marxist ideology that emerged during the Russian Revolution from the beliefs and ideas of Vladimir Lenin. It is ran entirely by a single communist party which has the end goal of achieving a fully socialist, classless society. It is considered the most authoritarian of the veins of Marxism, which garners criticism from all ideological spectrums."
libertarian_marxist_subtype_desc:0 "Libertarian Marxism is a Marxist ideology that believes in the ability of the workers to forge their own destiny without a need for a revolutionary government first. Since the German Revolution, Luxemburgism has become the major vein of Libertarian Marxism. Libertarian Marxists criticize social democracy for its moderate stance and also often oppose the authoritarian left, preferring semi-democracy."
revolutionary_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Revolutionary Socialism is a group of ideologies that consider revolution a requirement in order to transition to a fully socialist society and economy. It often includes ideologies such as democratic socialism, anarchism and syndicalism. Generally, revolutionary socialists reject the idea of establishing an authoritarian state and prefer democracy or semi-democracy, though ideas differ."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is a moderately left wing ideology that advocates for socialist components, such as welfare, within democracy and capitalism. Intended as a middle ground between capitalism and revolutionary socialism, it has gained popularity in many western democracies with the rise of socialism elsewhere. However, the moderate stance of social democrats has garnered criticism from the far left and right."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social Liberalism is a centrist ideology that advocates for a free market economy with some level of social benefits. It believes the government should actively address social issues such as poverty, health care and education. Less economically involved that social democracy, it has replaced the classical veins of liberalism in favor of a new, modern strand of centrist leftism."
liberal_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Liberal Conservatism is a right leaning centrist ideology that advocates for an entirely free market where private property allowed and encouraged. Liberal Conservatives very rarely support government regulation of the economy, and will combat anything they feel threatens the free market. However, liberal conservatives do not completely reject the idea of compromise, and are far less reactionary than social conservatives."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Social Conservatism is a right wing ideology that believes society should be based on tradition. Followers of the ideology will oppose all types of social reform, and are often called reactionary for opposing most types of changes that drastically affect the status quo. Social Conservatives are often willing to work with more radically right wing ideologies in order to stop reform before it begins."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian Democracy is a right wing ideology that offers some level of democracy while still retaining a supreme leader. It is common within semi-constitutional monarchies, and is seem as a more successful alternative to absolutism in the modern era. Though Authoritarian Democrats have become increasingly alienated by the far right, far left and the moderates, many nations still follow a vein of the ideology."
right_wing_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Right Wing Populism is a broad spectrum of ideologies that are ran almost entirely by unelected officials. Considered far right on the political spectrum, some examples include military dictatorships, absolute monarchies and some types of nationalist or reactionary ideologies. They are vehemently opposed to most moderate and far left ideologies, seeing them as a danger to the state."
national_syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "National Syndicalism is a right wing ideology that uses labour unions as a means to advance national development. Often considered a left leaning version of fascism, it is almost always ran by a one party dictatorship, with its main difference being the manipulation of trade unions, not the state funded creation of them. Many National Syndicalists integrate religious nationalism into their beliefs."
corporatist_fascist_subtype_desc:0 "Corporatist Fascism is a radical form of right wing nationalism that is authoritarian in nature. Often consisting of a one party dictatorship, corporatist fascists advocate for the creation of corporations, or state ran labour unions. The ultimate goal of corporatist fascism is to achieve self sufficiency. Corporatist Fascists often rule unopposed and without free elections, and suppression of minorities is common."
