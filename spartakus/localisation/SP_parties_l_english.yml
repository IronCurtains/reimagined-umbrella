leninist_subtype_desc:0 "Leninism emerged during the Russian Revolution from the tactics and theory of Vladimir Lenin. It is described by many of its followers as 'Marxism of the era of imperialism and the proletarian revolution', and these two areas are the focus of its theory. Leninism has the stated end goal of achieving a communist, classless society. Considered by some to be authoritarian or ultra-left Jacobinism, it garners criticism from across the ideological spectrum."
marxist_subtype_desc:0 "Marxism is a political ideology that believes material circumstances of capitalism will inevitably lead to workers' revolts and revolutions for emancipation. Marxists often criticize social democracy as reinforcing capitalism and other forms of socialism for utopianism, reformism or idealism. Marxists of the council-communist and other varieties also criticise Leninism and related forms of Marxism, believing in other methods to achieve the dictatorship of the proletariat."
revolutionary_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Revolutionary socialism is a group of ideologies not directly related to Marxism that also consider revolution a requirement in order to transition to a socialist economic and political system. It often includes ideologies such as syndicalism, anarcho-syndicalism and some forms of anarchism. Generally, most revolutionary socialists reject the Marxist and Leninist vision of a dictatorship of the proletariat, though ideas differ."
democratic_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Democratic socialism is considered the most moderate socialist ideology. Not to be confused with social democracy, it advocates for a socialist economy but with standard parliamentary functions. Generally, democratic socialists are vehemently opposed to the Leninist model of socialism, and also criticize the capitalistic nature of social democrats. Democratic socialists do not advocate for a revolution nor workers councils, which sometimes puts them at odds with the further left."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social democracy is a moderately left wing ideology that advocates for socialist components, such as welfare, within democracy and capitalism. Intended as a middle ground between capitalism and socialism, it has gained popularity in many western democracies. However, the moderate stance of social democrats has garnered criticism from the far left and right, and the previously strong social democrats in Germany and other socialist countries have become completely discredited by both sides."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a centrist ideology that advocates for a free market economy with some level of social benefits. It believes the government should actively address social issues such as poverty, health care and education. Less economically involved that social democracy, it has replaced the classical veins of liberalism in favor of a new, modern strand of centrist leftism."
liberal_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Liberal conservatism is a right leaning centrist ideology that advocates for an entirely free market where private property allowed and encouraged. Liberal conservatives very rarely support government regulation of the economy, and will combat anything they feel threatens the free market. However, liberal conservatives do not completely reject the idea of compromise, and are far less reactionary than social conservatives."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Social conservatism is a right wing ideology that believes society should be based on tradition. Followers of the ideology will oppose all types of social reform, and are often called reactionary for opposing most types of changes that drastically affect the status quo. Social conservatives are often willing to work with more radically right wing ideologies in order to stop reform before it begins."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is a right wing ideology that offers some level of democracy while still retaining a supreme leader. It is common within semi-constitutional monarchies, and is seen as a more successful alternative to absolutism in the modern era. Though authoritarian democrats have become increasingly alienated by the far right, far left and the moderates, many nations still follow a vein of the ideology."
right_wing_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Right-wing populism is a broad spectrum of ideologies that are ran almost entirely by non-elected officials. Considered far right on the political spectrum, some examples include military dictatorships, absolute monarchies and some types of nationalist or reactionary ideologies. They are vehemently opposed to most moderate and far left ideologies, seeing them as a danger to the state."
national_syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "National syndicalism is a right wing ideology that uses syndicates, also known as labour unions, as a means to advance national development. In standard syndicalism, workers manage the syndicates themselves, but in national syndicalism they are organized to benefit the state. Although it is often considered to be related to national corporatism, it is also often considered to be more 'left' leaning. Many national syndicalists integrate religious nationalism into their beliefs."
national_corporatist_subtype_desc:0 "National corporatism is a radical form of right wing nationalism that is authoritarian in nature. Often consisting of a one party dictatorship, national corporatists advocate for the creation of corporations, which can be government owned or privately owned, though most often national corporatists see to total government control of the corporations. The ultimate goal of national corporatism is to achieve self sufficiency. National corporatists often rule unopposed and without free elections, and suppression of minorities is common."
