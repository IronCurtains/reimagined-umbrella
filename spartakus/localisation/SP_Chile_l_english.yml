chile.1.t:0 "Chile in 1932"
chile.1.d:0 "After the Pacific War, in which Chile gained the saltpeter-rich provinces of Arica and Antofagasta, Chile entered an economic golden age. The Great War, while the cause of chaos and revolution in some nations, benefited Chile's economy immensely, as demand for saltpeter skyrocketed. However, the war would also prove to be the saltpeter industry's downfall, as the chemical processes engineered during the war to artificially synthethise saltpeter meant that mining saltpeter simply was not as profitable as it once was. This, combined with the American economic crash, caused chaos, bordering on anarchy in Chile. Large strikes and revolts erupted in the north of the country, which were only shut down by brute force. Only last year, a massive portion of the great Chilean Navy mutinied, a mutiny which was only crushed by aerial bombardment of the rebelling ships. Left-wing parties, from populist followers of former president Ibáñez, to the Socialist Party, to even the IWW and Communist Party, grew rapidly, especially within the military. Amidst this chaos, Juan Esteban Montero was elected President, in a grand coalition of Radicals, Conservatives, and Liberal dissenters. However, his policies of austerity have only made things worse, as debt and unemployment continues to skyrocket. Under this strain, can the republic survive?"
chile.1.a:0 "Interesting"
chile.2.t:0 "Socialists Attempt Coup!"
chile.2.d:0 "A group of young socialists under Eugenio Matte have staged a coup by seizing El Bosque Air Base in Santiago, along with Air Force personell under Marmaduke Grove, and followers of former president Ibáñez under Carlos Dávila. We could call in the military to put down the coup, but we don't really know how much of the military might join the Socialists instead of putting them down."
chile.2.a:0 "We can't risk it, let Montero resign..."
chile.2.b:0 "Call in the military to crush the reds!"
chile.3.t:0 "Creation of the Government Junta of the Socialist Republic"
chile.3.d:0 "The victorious revolutionaries have announced the creation of the Government Junta of the Socialist Republic, or Socialist Junta for short. Comprising a group of socialists and socialist-sympathisers under retired general Arturo Puga, it will take the role of President for the time being. However, many other leftist groups, such as the trade unions under the TIM, the Leninists under the PCCh, and the Luxemburgists under the Izquierda Comunista have refused to support us, and we only have the support of the Ibáñezistas, the military, and the Socialists"
chile.3.a:0 "Very good"
chile.4.t:0 "Carlos Dávila Resigns"
chile.4.d:0 "Carlos Dávila, a member of the Ibáñezista faction of the Socialist Junta, has resigned, officially in protest of the increasingly radical direction proposed by Eugenio Matte and Marmaduke Grove. However, Dávila does have a sizable base of support within the leftists in the Army, and some suggest he could be planning a counter-coup."
chile.4.a:0 "Keep an eye on him"
chile.5.t:0 "Ibáñezista Coup"
chile.5.d:0 "Carlos Dávila, who recently resigned as a member of the Junta, has returned to Santiago with the support of the Ibáñezista faction of the Army. He demands to be given the position of Acting President, and for the 'communists' Grove and Matte to be dismissed. While his force seems intimidating, we still have the support of the Navy, the Air Force, and a large portion of the Army, but the Junta is weary of bringing fighting to the streets of Santiago."
chile.5.a:0 "Resign in favor of Dávila"
chile.5.b:0 "Crush the putschists"
chile.6.t:0 "Aftermath of Dávila's Coup"
chile.6.d:0 "While Dávila's coup has been crushed, and Dávila himself has been exiled to Easter Island, the attempted coup has revealed the weakness of our heavily divided Junta. Grove has begun to suggest that he, as the leader of the Socialist Party, be given the reins of government as Acting President, so he can attempt to gather support from the other factions of the Left. However, Arturo Puga could simply appoint himself Acting President and use his respected position within the military to strengthen the Socialist Republic."
chile.6.a:0 "Appoint Marmaduke Grove"
chile.6.b:0 "Appoint Arturo Puga"
chile.7.t:0 "Left-Wing Purge"
chile.7.d:0 "The abortive coup has proved that the left is nothing more than a gang of scoundrels and traitors who will take any opportunity to overthrow democracy. Already, trade union leaders, communists, Ibáñezistas, and socialists are being arrested and sent into exile on Easter Island. Democracy is now safe from red subversion."
chile.7.a:0 "Montero has secured the Republic"
chile.8.t:0 "Meeting with the PCCh"
chile.8.d:0 "We have arranged a meeting with the leaders of the PCCh, to see if it would be possible to invite them into government. We are offering them positions in government in exchange for declaring support for our regime."
chile.8.a:0 "Let us begin"
chile.9.t:0 "The PCCh accepts"
chile.9.d:0 "The PCCh has decided to accept our deal, and are now taking positions in lower levels of government. The left is one step closer to unification."
chile.9.a:0 "Great news!"
chile.10.t:0 "The PCCh present a counteroffer"
chile.10.d:0 "Discontent with the current offer being presented to them, the PCCh have proposed a counteroffer, in which they would support our government in return for not only government positions, but some reforms in line with their Leninist beliefs. What should our response be?"
chile.10.a:0 "Accept the counteroffer"
chile.10.b:0 "Send back a counter-counteroffer"
chile.10.c:0 "They have pushed their luck too far, cancel the negotiations!"
chile.11.t:0 "The PCCh declines"
chile.11.d:0 "The PCCh have cancelled our meeting at the last minute, probably due to opposition from within. They have also released an official statement reinforcing their position that our government is illegitimate."
chile.11.a:0 "Damn Bolsheviks!"
chile.12.t:0 "The PCCh accepts"
chile.12.d:0 "The PCCh have decided to accept our counter-counteroffer. In exchange for support for our regime, they will recieve positions in government and some moderate reforms in a leninist direction."
chile.12.a:0 "Great news!"
chile.13.t:0 "The PCCh declines"
chile.13.d:0 "The PCCh have declined our counter-counteroffer, and appear to be insulted, as they are now demanding even more reforms in exchange for our support. What should our response be?"
chile.13.a:0 "We have no choice, accept"
chile.13.b:0 "They have pushed their luck too far, decline!"
chile.14.t:0 "Meeting with the Izquierda Comunista"

chile.17.t:0 "The Izquierda Comunista declines"
chile.17.d:0 "The Izquierda Comunista have cancelled our meeting at the last minute, probably due to opposition from within. They have also released an official statement reinforcing their position that our government is militarist and bonapartist, representing more 'barracks communism' than true socialism."
chile.17.a:0 "Damn Marxists!"
chile.18.t:0 "The Izquierda Comunista accepts"
chile.18.d:0 "The Izquierda Comunista have decided to accept our counter-counteroffer. In exchange for support for our regime, they will recieve positions in government and some moderate reforms in a leninist direction."

chile.20.t:0 "Meeting with the Unions"
chile.20.d:0 "We have arranged a meeting with prominent union leaders, especially those from the CGT and TIM (IWW), to see if it would be possible to invite them into government. We are offering them positions in government in exchange for declaring support for our regime."

chile.21.t:0 "The Unions accept"
chile.21.d:0 "The syndicalists have decided to accept our deal, and are now taking positions in lower levels of government. The left is one step closer to unification."
chile.21.a:0 "Great news!"
chile.22.t:0 "The Unions present a counteroffer"
chile.22.d:0 "Discontent with the current offer being presented to them, the syndicalists have proposed a counteroffer, in which they would support our government in return for not only government positions, but some reforms in line with their Syndicalist beliefs. What should our response be?"
chile.22.a:0 "Accept the counteroffer"

chile.25.a:0 "We have no choice, accept"
chile.25.b:0 "They have pushed their luck too far, cancel the negotiations!"
chile.26.t:0 "First Convention of the Popular Unity Coalition"
chile.26.d:0 "Although something resembling a socialist coalition has been formed, no unified policy has been proposed, and to the lament of the other parties within the coalition, the Socialist Party retains near-absolute control over both the government and the coalition. In order to give our government more legitimacy and to satisfy these voices, we have decided to hold a convention in which party delegates from all over Chile will meet to discuss politics and strategy."
chile.26.a:0 "Welcome, comrades!"
chile.27.t:0 "First Popular Unity Convention - Political Organization"
chile.27.d:0 "The first day of debates seems to have developed into a debate about how the new government should be organized politically. The PCCh argues for a strong vanguard party, with no tolerance for internal factionalism or sedition. The Izquierda Comunista, on the other hand, proposes a more moderate solution to the problem of internal disputes. They propose that all other political organizations within Chile to be driven underground, but too simultaneously allow for a large degree of democracy and open debate within the coalition. The syndicalists, of course, believe that power should be transferred to the unions, specifically in the form of the Central Congress of the CGT-TIM, the recently-formed union between the mainline CGT and the more radical Chilean branch of the IWW. The Socialists, finally, argue for as many pre-revolutionary institutions to be maintained as possible, so as not to jeopardize the socialist republic even more."
chile.27.a:0 "PCCh - Vanguard Party"
chile.27.b:0 "IC - Internal Democracy"
chile.27.c:0 "Syndicalists - All Power to the Unions!"
chile.27.e:0 "PSC - Preserve Liberal Institutions"
chile.28.t:0 "First Popular Unity Convention - Economic Policy"
chile.28.d:0 "The debate seems to have meandered into an argument over the economic policy of the nation. The PCCh propose a strong body to centrally plan the economy to rapidly industrialize it, in the style of Soviet five year plans. The Izquierda Comunista propose creating a system based on workers councils, similar to the one emerging in the German Socialist Republic. The syndicalists, of course, argue for an orthodox syndicalist approach, with economic power being transferred to the unions. The Socialists propose a fusion of socialist policies and a market-based economy, abolishing capitalists while not abolishing capitalism."
chile.28.a:0 "PCCh - Central Planning"
chile.28.b:0 "IC - Councilism"
chile.28.c:0 "Syndicalists - Orthodox Syndicalism"
chile.28.e:0 "PSC - Market Socialism"
chile.29.t:0 "First Popular Unity COnvention - Foreign Affairs"
chile.29.d:0 "Now, the conversation seems to mainly concern what direction the nation should take in foreign affairs. The PCCh and the Izquierda Comunista both support joining the Comintern, but they have very different ideas on which faction of the Comintern we should align with. The PCCh support aligning ourselves with the home of the revolution, the Soviet Union, while the Izquierda Comunista supports siding with Germany, who are economically more similar to urban Chile, and according to them are a far better example of socialism than the 'revisionist' Soviet Union. Surprisingly, the Socialists and Syndicalists are uniting on this issue, believing that Chile and South America have far different material circumstances than any European nation, and thus require a form of socialism tailored to South America, without the interference of European powers."
chile.29.a:0 "PCCh - Join the Comintern (Soviet Alignment)"
chile.29.b:0 "IC - Join the Comintern (German Alignment"
chile.29.c:0 "Syndicalists/PSC - South American Socialism"
chile.30.t:0 "First Popular Unity Convention - Military"
chile.30.d:0 "The debate has finally reached the most controversial subject: the military. While the military were the force that ushered in the Socialist Republic, many members of the coalition are still suspicious of the military, as well as the military doctrine they represent. The PCCh support bringing in Soviet Advisors in to train our army in how best to utilize artillery and other auxiliary equipment, along with a hefty dose of purges and reshuffling. The Izquierda Comunista counter that the new tactics coming out of Germany will be far more useful, advocating mobile warfare through the use of tanks and trucks. The Syndicalists, like the PCCh, distrust the current military, but unlike the PCCh, they also distrust the idea of a centralized military in general. They propose that the military should largely be dissolved, and defense be handled by worker and peasant militias recruited from the unions. The Socialists are still desperately trying to convince the other delegates that no change to the old Republic's tactics are necessary, as they are the best suited to mountainous Chile. They also contend that the military is a trustworthy, even socialist body that should be strengthened, not weakened. The debate is beginning to get ugly, and we should probably get to a conclusion immediately."
chile.30.a:0 "PCCh - Soviet Advisors"
chile.30.b:0 "IC - German Advisors"
chile.30.c:0 "Syndicalists - Militia-Based Army"
chile.30.e:0 "PSC - Status Quo"
chile.32.t:0 "PCCh Victory"
chile.32.d:0 "After much debate, it seems like the Partido Comunista de Chile have come out on top in the convention. Carlos Contreras Labarca is the new leader of the Popular Unity coalition as well as effective President of Chile. The PCCh are now free to implement their Leninist policies in Chile, at least for the time being."
chile.32.a:0 "Venceremos!"
chile.33.t:0 "Izquierda Comunista Victory"
chile.33.d:0 "After much debate, it seems like the Izquierda Comunista have come out on top in the convention. Manuel Hidalgo is the new leader of the Popular Unity coalition as well as effective President of Chile. The IC are now free to implement their German-inspired policies in Chile, at least for the time being."
chile.33.a:0 "Venceremos!"
chile.34.t:0 "Syndicalist Victory"
chile.34.d:0 "After much debate, it seems like the Syndicalists have come out on top in the convention. Bernardo Ibáñez is the new leader of the Popular Unity coalition as well as effective President of Chile. The unions are now free to implement their syndicalist policies in Chile, at least for the time being."
chile.34.a:0 "Venceremos!"
chile.35.t:0 "PSC Victory"
chile.35.d:0 "After much debate, it seems like the Partido Socialista de Chile have come out on top in the convention. However, there has been a challenge to Marmaduke Grove's leadership of the Socialists from within. Salvador Allende, seen by many as a more 'new blood' figure less tainted with military politics, has recently been attempting to gather support for a leadership challenge against Grove. Grove and Allende both have about the same amount of support, so it seems impossible to tell who will become the new leader of the Socialists and President of Chile."
chile.35.a:0 "Grove defends his position"
chile.35.b:0 "Allende defeats Grove and is inaugurated as President"
chile.36.t:0 "Runoff Election"
chile.36.d:0 "After a week of debate, no one faction has obtained a clear majority in the convention, and so a runoff election has been held, with the only options being the two factions with the greatest amount of support."
chile.36.a:0 "The PCCh Wins"
chile.36.b:0 "The Izquierda Comunista Wins"
chile.36.c:0 "The Syndicalists Win"
chile.36.e:0 "The PSC Wins"

CHL_groves_republic_desc:0 "Marmaduke Grove has finally been appointed acting President of the Socialist Republic after a failed coup by Carlos Dávila. He hopes to mend the rift with the other socialist parties, and pursue a radical socialist agenda for the republic. He also wishes to reduce the influence of the armed forces within Chile, and gradually return to civilian rule."
