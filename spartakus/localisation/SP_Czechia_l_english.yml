cze.0.t:0 "The Czech Republic"
cze.0.desc:0 "The Czechoslovak Republic was born in a period of turmoil. Originally claiming the German parts of Bohemia as well as Slovakia, the Czechoslovak National Council had fought hard for the establishment of a Czechoslovak state, and thousands of Czechs served in the Czechoslovak Legion against the Central Powers in the Great War. Before they were able to fully consolidate their rule over the whole of the country, however, the Hungarian communists declared war for Slovakia, and shortly after, the Bohemian Germans rose up and joined the German Red Army. Overwhelmed on all sides, the government decided to focus on protecting their Czech lands, and signed a truce with the communists. \n\nSince then, Czech democracy has been stewarded by the guiding hand of President Masaryk. The ruling coalition, the Pětka or Committee of Five, has overwhelming control of the National Assembly, and continues to cooperate for the good of the nation. \n\nSome worry, though, that Masaryk's age will compel him to withdraw from politics over the coming years, and such an event may spell the end of the Pětka. Most Czechs cannot even fathom such a thing, but they may be faced with the unthinkable soon enough."
cze.0.a:0 "Pravda vítězí!"
cze.1.t:0 "The Great Depression Reaches Czechia"
cze.1.desc:0 "It was only a matter of time before the effects of the Wall Street Crash would reach Czechia. Our primary trading partners are already feeling the effects, which has had an immediate impact upon our markets. Imports are slowing, and it seems that we may be left even more economically isolated than we already are."
cze.1.a:0 "This is a dark day for the Czech Republic."
cze.2.t:0 "Independent Czechoslovak State Day"
cze.2.desc.a:0 "28 October is the anniversary of the Czechoslovak National Council taking power in Prague in 1918. It is a day of nation-wide celebration - but also a day of mourning our lost territories, and for dreaming of the day when all the rightful Czechoslovak lands are reunited under our banner."
cze.2.desc.b:0 "28 October is the anniversary of the Czechoslovak National Council taking power in Prague in 1918. As we fight to reclaim our rightful territory, our soldiers are filled with a renewed sense of purpose."
cze.2.desc.c:0 "28 October is the anniversary of the Czechoslovak National Council taking power in Prague in 1918. It is a day of nation-wide celebration - especially since having made Czechoslovakia whole once more. As grand celebtations are held in the cities and throughout the countryside, our government has also taken the initiative to organise special events in our recently liberated territories to commemorate the occasion."
cze.2.a:0 "Pravda vítězí!"
cze.3.t:0 "Our Priorities"
cze.3.desc:0 "It has become clear that we must invest considerably in the nation in order to salvage our economy, even if it means our government will go into debt. There are two areas that require our attention: industry and agriculture. \n\nAlthough Bohemia was the industrial heartland of Austria-Hungary, a large part of our industry in the German-populated areas was stolen away by the German communists during the revolutionary fervour of 1919. We still have a considerable industrial capacity, but it requires investment in order to grow and bring our economy back to acceptable levels. \n\nThe Bohemian lands have never been an agricultural centre, however, and the vast agricultural lands of Slovakia - rightfully ours - were also conquered in 1919. Since then, our populace has been subject to constant rationing. Although food imports have helped to alleviate the crisis since the end of the chaos of the revolutionary period, it is crucial that we increase our own agricultural output. \n\nWe can only address one of these issues at a time. Which will we address first?"
cze.3.a:0 "We will prioritise industry."
cze.3.b:0 "We will prioritise agriculture."
cze.4.t:0 "Death of the Iron Rector"
cze.4.desc:0 "August Naegle, the German \"Iron Rector\" of Charles University, was found dead this morning after passing peacefully in his sleep. \n\nCharles University is the oldest university in Czechia, and was one of the most prominent in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In the late 19th century, the institution was split into the German university and the Czech university, to satisfy ethnic tensions, but with the fall of the empire and the foundation of the Czech Republic, the question of which language would dominate the institution was revived. \n\nFor years, the university has been caught between the two camps: the minority Germans, who still hold a fair amount of sway over the institution, and the majority Czechs. The crux of the conflict: the insignia of the original university, officially shared between the two, but now claimed by both the German and Czech faculties as their own. \n\nAugust Naegle had been instrumental in maintaining the German university, and with his death, there are rumblings among the faculty once more. Ethnic tensions have for years been kept at bay in the Czech Republic, but some worry that this will spark renewed conflict."
cze.4.a:0 "How fierce can academics really get?"
cze.5.t:0 "Masaryk suffers a stroke!"
cze.5.desc.a:0 "President Masaryk has suffered a stroke! He is aready recovering well, but some whisper that this may spell the definitive end of his political career. Although he has expressed in the past that he does not wish to stand for for a fourth term in the upcoming presidential election, and hopes that his protégé Edvard Beneš may succeed him, Beneš may not have enough support within the parliament to maintain the status quo if Masaryk steps down. \n\nWith this event bringing these worries back to the surface, it is time to make a definitive statement on the matter. Will Masaryk stand for another election?"
cze.5.desc.b:0 "Former President Masaryk has suffered a stroke. Although he is recovering, this is a great blow to the forces of \"democracy\" in the Czech Republic. Masaryk was always the government's uniting force, and without such a strong figure for the various parties to look to in common, they will never unite to oppose us."
cze.5.a:0 "Yes, Masaryk will stand once more."
cze.5.b:0 "No, this will be Masaryk's last term."
cze.5.c:0 "With this, the \"democratic\" opposition to our regime is weakened."


cze.10.t:0 "1934 Presidential Election"
cze.10.desc.a:0 "President Masaryk's third term has come to an end, and with it, a new presidential election has been called. The President is elected by the bicameral parliament of 300 Deputies and 150 Senators, and needs 60% of the vote in order to be elected. \n\nMasaryk is now 84 years old, and would have liked his protégé Edvard Beneš to succeed him. Beneš's support within the parliament is tenuous however, so Masaryk has stood once more for election in order to maintain the political status quo. There is no meaningful opposition to him."
cze.10.desc.b:0 "President Masaryk's third term has come to an end, and with it, a new presidential election has been called. The President is elected by the bicameral parliament of 300 Deputies and 150 Senators, and needs 60% of the vote in order to be elected. \n\nDue to his ailing health at 84 years, Masaryk has declined to stand for a fourth term. His preferred successor is his protégé, Edvard Beneš of the National Socialists (ČSNS). However, Beneš may prove to lack sufficient support to be elected. He is supported by the Social Democrats (ČSDSD) and the Populars (ČSL). \n\nThe Agrarian Party (ČSA) has nominated Bohumil Němec. He is supported by the National Democrats (ČND), as well as the minor Czech Traders' Party (ČŽOS) and the far-right National Corporatist Community (NOK).\n\nThe Communists, as usual, have nominated their own candidate, but many of the communists may choose to support Beneš as a counter to the far-right bloc forming around Němec. \n\nIn any case, it appears that the end of the Pětka coalition that has governed our country for over a decade may be at hand."
cze.10.a:0 "Elect Masaryk once more!"
cze.10.b:0 "Elect Edvard Beneš!"
cze.10.c:0 "Elect Bohumil Němec!"



czegajda.0.t:0 "The Rebellious Gajda"
czegajda.0.desc:0 "Radola Gajda, a general in the Czech Army, has been a thorn in the side of our government for years. Rumours have swirled around him since the mid-1920s, but as nothing concrete has been found, we have been unable to rid ourselves of him once and for all. \n\nHowever, his involvement with the radical right-wing party, the Národní obec korporativistická (NOK) has many in our government worried. He remains popular among many of the old Legionaries, and so manages to hold sway over a significant portion of the army. We must combat his influence to ensure that the army remains under civilian control."
czegajda.0.a:0 "We shall prevail!"
czegajda.1.t:0 "Gajda Speaks Out"
czegajda.1.desc:0 "In flagrant disregard for protocol, Gajda has spoken out publicly against his supsension. He claims that he is being targetted unfairly, and has denounced both the government's actions and the rumours around him being peddled by the press."
czegajda.1.a:0 "How dare he?!"
czegajda.2.t:0 "Gajda Active as Ever"
czegajda.2.desc:0 "Despite our little \"gift\" to him, and its implicit urging for him to retire, Gajda has shown no motion towards doing so. It appears that although he has accepted our \"gift,\" and indeed quieted down for a few weeks, he will continue to actively pursue his military career as well as his involvement with the NOK."
czegajda.2.a:0 "Damn."
czegajda.3.t:0 "Raiding Štít Národa"
czegajda.3.desc:0 "We have raided the offices of Štít Národa, a far-right newspaper that supports Gajda's National Corporatist Community (NOK), on charges of conspiring against the government. The evidence we have to support this is tenuous, but it is true that many of their articles have called for the establishment of an anti-liberal government – a proposition that inherently challenges the foundations of our very republic. \n\nWhat measures should we take against them?"
czegajda.3.a:0 "Only search their offices and harass them."
czegajda.3.b:0 "Arrest a few prominent members."
czegajda.3.c:0 "Shut them down permanently!"
czegajda.4.t:0 "Unrest in the Streets"
czegajda.4.desc:0 "A new paramilitary group has arisen in Prague and other cities: Obrana. Although officially, Obrana and the NOK are unaffiliated, Obrana uses much of the same rhetoric and supports many of the same positions as the far-right party, and from what little the police have been able to gather so far, share much of the same membership."
czegajda.4.a:0 "These hooligans are threatening our democracy!"
czegajda.5.t:0 "Dělnická Stráž"
czegajda.5.desc:0 "In order to counter the Obrana paramilitary group, our government has allowed the creation of a communist-aligned paramilitary group, the Dělnická Stráž or Workers' Guard. Although some fear that this will only serve to strengthen the communists' position, we hope that they and the NOK supporters will ultimately make each other impotent."
czegajda.5.a:0 "I hope this works...."
czegajda.6.t:0 "Anti-NOK Publications"
czegajda.6.desc:0 "We have decided to sponsor anti-NOK articles in the newspapers, in the hopes of weakening Gajda's popular support while it's still meagre. However, we have to be covert, so we have only a small amount of money put aside for it. We will have to focus our support on a single publication."
czegajda.6.a:0 "The National Socialists' newspaper, České slovo!"
czegajda.6.b:0 "The Social Democrats' newspaper, Právo lidu!"
czegajda.6.c:0 "The Communists' newspaper, Rudé právo!"
czegajda.7.t:0 "NOK MPs Protest"
czegajda.7.desc:0 "The Members of Parliament from Gajda's NOK are protesting the shutdown of Štít Národa, their unofficial party newspaper. They're accusing the Pětka coalition of impeding true democracy and stifling freedom of speech."
czegajda.7.a:0 "We have nothing to say."
czegajda.8.t:0 "Clashes in the Streets!"
czegajda.8.desc.aa:0 "Last night, a far-right rally aligned with the NOK turned violent when communist and other left-wing counterprotestors arrived to demonstrate against corporatism and antisemitism. It's unclear who struck first, but it quickly devolved into a riot. \n\nThe police eventually quelled the riot, but it was a clear tactical victory for the communists."
czegajda.8.desc.ab:0 "When Obrana members marched through the streets last night, they were faced with an impromptu counterprotest made up of communists and other left-wing sympathisers. It's unclear who struck first, but it quickly devolved into a riot. \n\nThe police eventually quelled the riot, but it was a clear tactical victory for the communists."
czegajda.8.desc.ac:0 "When Obrana members marched through the streets last night, they came face-to-face with a group of Dělnická Stráž members who had organised to \"defend workers and Jews from the corporatist menace.\" It's unclear who struck first, but the two groups quickly began fighting through the streets. Gunshots were heard from across the city. \n\nWhile the police worked to contain the clash, Dělnická Stráž emerged victorious."
